10	Guest Speaker: Kathy Young from Ft. Lauderdale, FL.		Our featured guest speaker for June, 2000, Kathy Young, will talk about\r\nher comprehensive near-death experience and transformation as the result\r\nof a violent crime. Hers is a powerful message of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nKATHY YOUNG\r\n\r\nby Vanessa Bauza\r\n\r\nKathy Young sleeps in her shoes because short term memory loss makes it\r\ndifficult to find them in the morning. She brushes her teeth over the\r\nkitchen sink to avoid her scarred reflection in the bathroom mirror. Her\r\npockets are full of medicated drops to relieve the pain in her right\r\neye, which no longer blinks. Hers is a life reconstructed.\r\n\r\nFive years ago this month, a neighbor slipped into her Fort Lauderdale\r\nhome, beat her face in with a rifle butt, stabbed her seven times, raped\r\nher with a kitchen knife and sodomized her with the barrel of a shotgun.\r\nHer attacker, Rodney Wayne Jones, 45, lived down the street from Young\r\nbut the two barely knew each other. While Jones got 22 years for\r\nattempted murder and other charges, Young says there are days she feels\r\nlike she is serving a life sentence.\r\n\r\nA nurse for 12 years, Young, 40, now lives off a Social Security\r\ndisability check and food donations from several charities.\r\n\r\nShe has short term memory loss from brain injuries and is incontinent.\r\nThrough it all she is committed to making her Flagler Heights\r\nneighborhood in northeast Fort Lauderdale a safer place. Since the\r\nattack, Young has become active in the Citizen\\'s Crime Alert and is\r\nhelping organize her community\\'s National Night Out on Crime tonight at\r\na nearby church.\r\n\r\nHers is one of scores of South Florida communities throwing block\r\nparties to support grassroots crime fighting. Organizers hope the\r\ncookouts, SWAT demonstrations and kiddie games will build community\r\nspirit and increase ties between police officers and residents. In the\r\npast year, Young has attended citizen\\'s police academy programs through\r\nthe Fort Lauderdale Police department and the Broward Sheriff\\'s Office.\r\nShe also completed the Broward County Fire Rescue Civilian Emergency\r\nResponse Team program to give her a better idea of what police deal with\r\non a daily basis.\r\n\r\nYoung\\'s dream is to start a support group for survivors of violent\r\ncrimes, something she said she hasn\\'t been able to find. \\"I want to be\r\nthe spark,\\" Young said. \\"People have been disabled by crime. There\\'s\r\na small minority of survivors but it\\'s out there and I want to reach\r\nit.\\" Young started to organize her neighborhood by walking door-to-door\r\nand handing out fliers for homeowner association and crime watch\r\nmeetings. Now some streets have been closed to limit traffic and Citizen\r\nCrime Watch signs are posted.\r\n\r\nCal Deal, past president of Citizens Crime Alert in Fort Lauderdale,\r\nsaid Young has been instrumental in spurring neighbors\\' to band against\r\ncrime -- be it by condemning dilapidated houses, organizing block\r\nparties or simply keeping an eye on each other\\'s homes. \\"She\\'s come\r\nout to the meetings and pushed people,\\" Deal said. \\"She was trying to\r\nsave Flagler Heights. The bad guys see this stuff and it affects them.\r\nIt changes the chemistry of the neighborhood. It\\'s second, I think,\r\nonly to what the police do.\\"\r\n\r\nFor Young, taking back her neighborhood is another mile marker on the\r\nroad to recovery. Because of her brain injuries diagnosed this spring,\r\nYoung takes hours completing simple tasks like showering and dressing.\r\nHer house is peppered with notes and daily reminders. Because she is\r\nincontinent, she plans errands days in advance and carefully regulates\r\nher diet.\r\n\r\nThe past five years have been full of adjustments great and small.\r\nSometimes it\\'s the little things she misses about her old life, like\r\nwearing her cheetah print or blue satin high heels. She still hasn\\'t\r\nhad the heart to give them away though she knows she\\'ll never wear them\r\nagain because of trouble balancing.\r\n\r\nStill, everyday she finds it a little easier to let the attack go. In\r\nOctober, she saw her trauma room photos for the first time. They show\r\nYoung\\'s face swollen, smeared with blood and crisscrossed with tubes.\r\nFor Young, they have made the attack more real, helping her get over a\r\nstage of denial. \\"They might be gruesome to other people but to me it\r\nwas proof that it really happened,\\" she said. \\"I thought for long time\r\nthat this was a bad dream. It took me a long time but I woke up.\\"\r\n\r\n	2000-06-10	2011-08-06 03:42:25.473723	2011-12-01 19:30:26.854992	<p>Our featured guest speaker for June, 2000, Kathy Young, will talk about\nher comprehensive near-death experience and transformation as the result\nof a violent crime.

32	Guest Speaker:  Melvin Morse, MD, Where God Lives		Melvin L. Morse is recognized in Woodword-White\\'s *Best Doctors in\r\nAmerica* as one of the top pediatricians in the country. He has a busy\r\nprivate practice in the suburbs of Seattle, Washington, USA. Dr. Morse\r\nhas researched near-death experiences in children and adults for over 15\r\nyears. He is married and has five children.\r\n\r\nHis interest in near-death experiences evolved from his experiences\r\nworking in Critical Care Medicine at Seattle Children\\'s Hospital; he\r\npublished the first description of a child\\'s near-death experience in\r\nmedical literature and was funded by the National Cancer Institute to\r\ncomplete the first case control prospective study in near-death\r\nexperiences. He was the head of the Seattle Study, the largest study in\r\nadults of the transformative aspects of the near-death experience to\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nDr. Morse graduated with academic honors from George Washington\r\nUniversity School of Medicine. He interned in Pediatrics at the\r\nUniversity of California at San Francisco and then completed a residency\r\nin Pediatrics at Seattle Children\\'s Hospital. He is the recipient of a\r\nNational Service Research Award and spent two years studying brain\r\ntumors and leukemia, also at Seattle Children�s Hospital.\r\n\r\nHe divides his time between his private practice of medicine and his\r\nteaching responsibilities. He is a Clinical Associate Professor of\r\nPediatrics at University of Washington, and developed the Pediatric\r\nteaching program for the Family Practice residency program at Valley\r\nGeneral Hospital. He has won numerous teaching awards. Dr. Morse was a\r\nfounder of the Pediatric Interim Care Center, one of the nation�s first\r\ntherapeutic foster homes for infants affected by prenatal exposure to\r\ncocaine.\r\n\r\nDr. Morse\\'s research has been featured in documentaries in Japan,\r\nAustralia, France, Canada, England, and the United States. He has\r\nappeared on numerous television and radio shows, including 20/20, The\r\nOprah Winfrey Show, The Turning Point, The Tom Snyder Show, the Larry\r\nKing Show, Good Morning America, Dateline, and Unsolved Mysteries, and\r\nhas been the subject of lengthy profiles in the Seattle Times, Tacoma\r\nNews Tribune, and the Los Angeles Times. He has numerous scientific\r\npublications on death-related visions, including The Lancet and the\r\nAmerican Medical Association�s Pediatric Journal.\r\n\r\nMorse\\'s first book,<i> Closer to the Light,</i> was an international\r\nbest seller and is published in 38 countries and 19 languages. It\r\nexplored the near-death experiences of children. His best-selling second\r\nbook, *Transformed by the Light,* is a long term follow up of these\r\nchildren as adults, and documents the physical and psychological\r\ntransformations resulting from near-death experiences. His third\r\nbook,<i> Parting Visions,</i> documents the entire range of spiritual\r\nvisions associated with death and dying, including premonitions of death\r\nand after death visitations. It focuses on how we can use these\r\nexperiences to help us to understand death, grief, and the often\r\noverlooked spiritual miracles in everyday life.\r\n\r\nIn his newest book, <i>Where God Lives </i>(Harper Collins, 2000), Dr.\r\nMorse reveals the area of the brain that is our biological link to the\r\nuniverse and shows us the secret of tapping into the universal energy to\r\nachieve healing, personal peace, and transcendence.\r\n\r\n<tt> \\"Melvin Morse\\'s, *Where God Lives,* ushers in new research on\r\nnear-death experiences for the twenty-first century.

Moody, Ph.D, M.D.\r\n\\"Melvin Morse has proven to be one of our most creative thinkers, a\r\nrare scientist who can not only evaluate the objective evidence but also\r\ncomprehend its larger implications. In this book, he combines his own\r\ncompelling personal experience with supporting scientific evidence to\r\nargue that there is a God Spot in our brains that allows us to interact\r\nwith the spiritual universe.

76	Guest Speaker:  Mellen-Thomas Benedict	NDEr from CA, will talk about his extensive experience on the other side and will focus on the practical application of the information received.	After suffering from a terminal illness, in 1982 Mellen-Thomas �died�\nand for an hour and a half he was monitored showing no vital signs.\nMiraculously he returned to his body with a complete remission of the\ndisease.\n\nWhile on the �other side� Mellen journeyed through several realms of\nconsciousness and beyond the �light at the end of the tunnel�. He was\nshown, in holographic detail, Earth�s past and a beautiful vision of\nmankind�s future for the next 400 years. He experienced the cosmology of\nour soul�s connection to mother earth (Gaia), our role in the Universe,\nand was gifted with access to Universal Intelligence.\n\nSince his near-death experience, Mellen-Thomas has maintained his direct\naccess to Universal Intelligence, and returns to the light at will,\nenabling him to be a bridge between science and spirit. He has been\ninvolved in research programs and has developed new technologies for\nhealth and wellness. With humility, insight, and depth of feeling he\nshares his experience and insights.\n\nHe brings back with him a message of hope and inspiration for humanity,\ndelivered with a joy and clarity that is refreshing. His depth of\nfeeling and passion for life is a gift to be shared.\n\nThe following are quotes from experts in the field of near-death\nresearch:\n\n�Mellen is able, while in trance, to see into microcosmic structures.\nalthough he maintains awareness in a hyper-alert state, it is clear that\nhe is able to simultaneously span several octaves of consciousness, from\nwhich he can acquire biological information that is extraordinary.�\n---Lee Pulos, Ph.D., Author of �Miracles and Other Realities,� Former\nPresident of the Canadian Society of Clinical Hypnosis and Senior\nPsychologist to the Olympic Team Canada.\n\n�Mellen-Thomas has the big picture.� �His story is one of the most\nremarkable I have encountered in extensive research on near-death\nexperiences. It is very rare that those who have died and returned have\nseen into the future to the extent that Mellen has. His vision of the\nfuture is one of hope.

38	Guest Speaker:  Caroline Sutherland 	Medical Intuitive, Near-Death Experiencer, and author of "The Body Knows."	<i>\\"Studying with Caroline Sutherland has made a positive difference in\nmy health. I feel younger than I did five years ago. Hay House is proud\nto publish her significant book.\\" --Louise L. Hay, author of<u> You Can\nHeal Your LIfe</u> </i> Caroline Sutherland: Near-Death Experiencer,\nMedical Intuitive and\nauthor of The Body �Knows,� will be guest speaker at the October meeting\nof Chicago IANDS on October 12, at 2 pm, at the Unity Church on the\nNorth Shore, 3434 Central, in Evanston.\n\n The gift of medical intuition came to Caroline Sutherland quite\nsuddenly, in 1985, when she was a physician�s assistant and\ndiagnostician for a very busy medical doctor who was practicing\nEnvironmental Medicine. She had been trained in the use of very specific\ndiagnostic allergy testing equipment and at a certain point, after using\nthe equipment for about a year, she would hear a very distinct voice\nguiding her to areas of the body and telling her to test specific\nsubstances which were not ordered on the test forms.\n\n This gift has continued for the past 16 years and Caroline has now\nworked with over 60,000 people in both clinical settings and private\nconsultations during this time. Her medical intuitive ability is very\nspecific to the physical body. Because of an extensive background in\nEnvironmental Medicine, she can see the body from that perspective and\ncan immediately read all of the foods that a person is\nallergic/sensitive to, see the main systems which are �down�, the state\nof the GI tract, immunity, hormone imbalances, weight problems,\nunderlying causes and when they may have begun and what precipitated\nthem etc.\n\n She does not need to be in the physical presence of the person. All she\nneeds to know is their name and a little about them, hear their voice or\nsee a photo. The minute she connects with the person seeking her help,\nshe is given a flood of data. The information is very specific, but the\nimbalances are only part of the picture. She can also see the\n�correction� ---what is needed to bring the body back into balance in\nterms of diet, supplements, botanicals, homeopathy and associated\nmodalities. Often, she can hold a bottle of vitamins or any other\nsubstance that a person is taking and know whether it is beneficial or\nnot. Among other perceptions, she has a sense of timing---how long it\nwill take the person to re-balance and whether or not that individual\nwill be compliant or if indeed they are likely to recover.\n\n Two significant spiritual events helped Caroline to evolve into her\ncurrent leadership role. One was an �angelic encounter� in 1985, which\nled Caroline to start her world-wide children�s ministry through the use\nof �Angels for Kids�---angel dolls and visualization audio tapes to\ncomfort children. And in 1995, Caroline had a brief but powerful glimpse\nof the other side when she was in a serious automobile accident, which\nwas a further catalyst for her work as a medical intuitive. On October\n12, she will talk about both of these experiences as well as her work,\nand those people attending the meeting will have an opportunity to sign\nup for individual assessments.\n\n	2002-10-12	2011-08-06 03:42:26.045346	2011-11-11 03:02:13.48429	<p><i>&ldquo;Studying with Caroline Sutherland has made a positive difference in\nmy health.

55	Guest Speaker:  Thomas Gates	Near-Death Experiencer, Founder of Soul Source, Author, Speaker, Healing Facilitator	Thomas Gates was born in Texas in 1950 and was the fourth of five\nchildren. He grew up in the rural countryside not far from Dallas, where\nhe and his brothers and sisters attended Catholic school. His father was\na fireman, and his loving mother was a homemaker and the quiet spiritual\nleader of the family. At the age of twelve he began working as a\nprofessional musician and soon became an accomplished drummer.\n\nHe spent much of his childhood playing in the woods, observing the\nstars, the sky, the trees, the animals, the changing of seasons, and the\neffortless flow of nature�s way. As a result he sensed that there must\nbe one simple and powerful essence sustaining all this incredibly\ndiverse creation.\n\nThen, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Thomas learned\nTranscendental Meditation. This brought the experience of the underlying\nwholeness of all creation and confirmed his sense of what had been\noccurring in nature all along. This euphoria lasted about one week when\nhe suddenly found himself being rushed to the hospital with a case of\nappendicitis.\n\nThomas found himself in what appeared to be a losing battle for his\nlife. Soon after the surgery, he heard the doctors announce to his\nfather, \\"We\\'re sorry. We\\'ve done everything we can. You should know\nthat he might not mike it.\\" Within moments Thomas began an amazing and\ngraceful journey all the way through and beyond the \\"light\\" to the\nunderlying, eternal source of his own existence and that of all\ncreation.\n\nAs the universe began to unfold before him, he experienced and\nunderstood many things about our creation. He encountered a magnificent\ngolden light and was completely absorbed by its powerful, healing\nwarmth. The greatest gift was the confirmation that we are all eternal\nand inseparable from our source, from one another, or from any other\nparticle of the universe. This experience forever changed his perception\nand understanding of life as he began a new journey back into the realm\nof human existence.\n\nAs he began to share his story with others, walking them through the\njourney, Thomas became aware that there appeared to be some subtle\nhealing value experienced by those with whom he shared. It seems to\nbring a greater sense of peace and increasing freedom from some\nunderlying fears without specifically addressing any particular fears.\nFear is an illusion created by the belief and the resulting experience\nthat we are separate from the source of our whole ness and its presence\nin all points of creation. With the spontaneous collapse of fear more\nwholeness is revealed. This can bring into our lives more than just the\nmemory of who we really are but, in fact, the experience of who we\nreally are.\n\nThomas was given the gift to draw from that same brilliant, golden light\nhe had encountered in his journey which brings spectrums that enliven\nthe body�s natural physical and emotional healing process. The spectrums\nnot only facilitate pain relief but also help release the underlying\nremnants of trauma in the physiology that give rise to physical and\nemotional dysfunction.\n\n<i> �When I heard Thomas share his story I was impressed by his simple\nand graceful manner of speaking. He was able to clearly describe\nsomething that is almost beyond description.\\"</i>--Radha Nayar,\nConsultant/CPA\n\n<i> \\"Thomas Gates is an exceptional speaker with an extraordinary\nmessage.

49	Guest Speaker:   Kimberly Clark Sharp	Social Worker, Near-Death Experiencer and Author of "After the Light"	 Kimberly Clark Sharp, M.S.W., has earned the title of &#65533;Near-Death Comedienne&#65533; through her many presentations about near-death experiences.

A clinical social worker, Sharp has taught at the University of Washington School of Medicine and at Seattle University. She lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband and children. Her book,<i> After the Light,</i> is a near-death classic, educating\nthousands about the near-death experience with much humor and tact,\ndelivering the serious message that we do not die in an irresistibly\nhumorous package. It is difficult to put her book down once you begin to\nread.\n\n\\"Death is nothing to fear - and life without fear can be lived to the\nfullest.\\"\n\nThis is Kimberly Clark Sharp\\'s message from her extraordinary\nexperience during the time after her heart suddenly stopped beating and\nshe lay on the sidewalk, not breathing, and without a pulse. Swept into\na peaceful loving place of brilliant golden light and warm comfort, she\nsaw, for the first time, the meaning of life - and death.\n\nThereafter, Kimberly, with hamster Toto at her side, left Kansas for\nSeattle - known as \\"the Emerald City\\" -- to fulfill a destiny devoted\nto the service of others as foreseen at the end of her near-death\nexperience. Guided by a new sensitivity to the presence of angels,\ndemons and other invisibilities, Kimberly attained a Masters degree in\nSocial Work at the University of Washington and began a career in\nmedical social work that put her in direct contact with dying people -\nand people who almost died and came back.\n\nIt is the inspirational stories of these near-death experiences, as well\nas Kimberly\\'s own life challenges in love, family life and the\ndiagnosis of breast cancer, that form the core of this surprisingly\nfunny page-turner of a book.\n\nBettie J.

52	Guest Speaker:  Charles Graybar	Author of "Beyond the Broken Gate" who discovered a portal and found answers more detailed than an NDE.	Charles Graybar started out studying physics and other core sciences\nfrom his teenage years onward. In his early 20\\'s, he shifted his focus\nand began a career in the media industry, and by 40, he had become\nsenior vice president for Capital Cities/ABC, the parent company of ABC\nTelevision and had gained broad notoriety as an expert in the media\nbusiness. Throughout his career he has been broadly quoted in The New\nYork Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, USA Today and many\nnational and international publications as well as making appearances on\nCNN\\'s Moneyline. Since the 1980\\'s Graybar has served on seven private\ncompany Boards of Directors and consulted to more than 30 Boards of\nDirectors of corporations and not-for-profit organizations.\n\nDespite his success in business as he reached his late 30\\'s he began to\nsee his life as ostensibly empty and lacking true purpose. While\nexperimenting with a combination of meditation techniques as a means of\nescaping the stresses of corporate life, in late 1993 he came across a\ngateway of sorts; this \\"portal\\", accessed through his accidentally-\ndiscovered combination of meditation methodologies, ultimately\nfacilitated the ability to communicate with, what was at first, an\nunidentifiable spiritual entity. Graybar initially dismissed this\nexperience entirely due largely to his early scientific training. Most\nsurprising of all though was that, several days later when he duplicated\nthe methods he had used to access this unusual pathway, he was able to\nduplicate the experience including the unusual communication with the\nadvanced spirit. The experiences were so acute and the insights gained\nthrough the spiritual entity so stunning that within a year of stumbling\nupon this unusual state of perception, Graybar left his secure corporate\nposition and began a near full-time pursuit of spiritual investigation\nand search for enlightenment.\n\nBeyond the Broken Gate, rated #1 on BiggerBooks.com within two months of\nits release, is a chronicle of his search to find meaning in both his\nstunning discovery and also the very purpose of life. Along this course,\nhe transitioned enormously from a scientific orientation with no belief\nin \\"a God which cannot be proven\\" to a hard-charging corporate\nexecutive with \\"no belief in a God that allows the terrible people in\nthe world to go unpunished\\" to a person whose entire life\\'s purpose\nhas become to walk through life with compassion as a dedicated spiritual\nperson who acknowledges \\"our irrefutable and essential connection with\nGod and each other.\\" Beyond the Broken Gate details the spiritual\nentities\\' brilliant insights on questions such as; why we live, what\nwe\\'re meant to do in this life and what comes after this experience\nthat we call life?\n\nCharles Graybar now looks back and acknowledges the many changes he has\nmade in his life. \\"I made a rather substantial transformation from a\nhard-charging Fortune 100 senior executive to a guy that now raises\nhorses and writes books for a living.\\" Along with spending his time\nwriting and tending to his horses, he is also a corporate board\nconsultant in addition to a group speaker who shares his spiritual\ninsights and life transformation.\n\nFor more info, visit his web site: [ *www.charlesgraybar.com*][1]\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.charlesgraybar.com \n	2003-12-13	2011-08-06 03:42:26.405495	2011-11-11 03:02:13.71948	<p>Charles Graybar started out studying physics and other core sciences\nfrom his teenage years onward.

60	CHICAGO CONFERENCE:   CREATIVITY FROM THE LIGHT!	Don't miss the big international IANDS conference at the Best Western - University Plaza in Evanston, IL, June 24-26. 	<tt> Three whole days of fabulous speakers! Three days of Healing\nConnection with the best healers available which represent some of the\ngifts that people acquire through their near-death experiences! Music,\nArt, Writing, and more skills will be demonstrated, discussed, enjoyed.\nA world of talented individuals sharing their amazing skills! </tt>\n\nThe International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS), in\nconjunction with the local chapter, Chicago IANDS, will present its\nannual conference: \\"Creativity from the Light,\\" on Thursday, Friday\nand Saturday, June 24-26, 2004 at the Best Western University Plaza\nHotel in Evanston, IL, which will explore the creativity which is often\nreleased during a near-death experience. Many near-death experiencers\n(NDErs) come back from their experiences with heightened sensitivities\nand miraculous gifts, e.g. increased intuitive ability, healing ability,\nand on other occasions, with artistic gifts, such as the ability to\nimprovise music, paint beautiful artworks or make significant literary\ncontributions.\n\nMany well-known personalities have benefited from the gifts of the NDE:\nPeter Fonda, Elizabeth Taylor, Christopher Reeve, Sharon Stone, David\nLetterman, R. Carlos Nakai, Howard Dean, Johnny Cash, and Burt Reynolds,\nto name a few of the very long list. It is estimated that there are now\nover 23,000,000 near-death survivors in the United States today. This\nvery common phenomenon brings not only tangible, creative gifts, but\nalso spiritual ones: an ability to view the world from a higher\nperspective, a greater sense of peace, more understanding of the nature\nof the the Universe, a connection to a higher power, and a loss of fear\nof dying.\n\nIANDS will bring from England, Peter Fenwick, M.D., an internationally\nknown neuropsychiatrist who is one of the world\\'s leading NDE\nresearchers; California artist, Andy Lakey, whose stunning angel\npaintings now fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars, and who had never\npainted before his NDE; Talented medical intuitive and NDEr, Caroline\nSutherland, from Vancouver, B.C.; and NDEr, comedienne and intuitive,\nDonna McCue, from Long Island, NY.\n\nThirty-two more speakers include well-known NDE researcher, PMH Atwater,\nUniversity of Illinois/Chicago professors, Steve Fanning (History) and\nNeal Grossman (Philosophy), Jungian psychologist Dr. Robert Moretti,\ndiscussing Jung\\'s two NDEs; psychologist Dr. Allan Botkin, After-Death\nCommunications (ADCs); Evanston internist, Dr. Robert Magrisso,\nwell-known Chicago minister, Rev. Ed Townley, and Asia Voight, who has\nhad four NDEs and can communicate with animals.\n\nA Pre-Conference lecture by David Kessler, \\"Using Your Experiences and\nCreativity in the Service of Others: Your Mission in End-of Life Care.\\"\nwill be open to the public on Wednesday evening, June 23, 7 pm, at the\nMusic Institute of Chicago (Auditorium) at 1490 Chicago Ave., Evanston.\nFor the cost of $35. each person will also receive a copy of David\\'s\nbest-selling book, The Needs of the Dying, and afterward, a chance to\nmeet David at a reception with live music.\n\nDavid Kessler is fast gaining a reputation as one of the best known\nexperts in the field of hospice and end-of-life care, as a result of\nreaching hundreds of thousands of people through his books. His newest\nbook is LIFE LESSONS: two experts on death and dying teach us about the\nmysteries of life and living, which is co-authored with Elisabeth Kübler\nRoss, who will be receiving IANDS\\' 2004 Lifetime Achievement Award at\nthis year\\'s conference. His work has been often discussed in the Los\nAngeles Times, the New York Times, Business Week and Life Magazine and\nhas been featured on CNN-Cross Fire, NBC, MSNBC, PBS, Entertainment\nTonight and Sally Jessy Raphael.\n\nOther exciting events during the conference include a three-day Healing\nConnection, which, for a registration fee of $7, conference attendees\ncan sample up to 60 minutes of healing sessions with some of the\noutstanding healers who have been the recipients of NDE \\"gifts.\\"\nHealing, palmistry, network chiropractic, rune stone readings, medical\nintuitive assessments and animal communication readings (please bring\nphoto, not the animal!) are among the offerings available. Also included\nare a bookstore run by Transitions Bookplace, Chicago\\'s best spiritual\nbookstore, an Art Exhibit with examples of \\"Creativity from the\nLight,\\" and Silent and Live Auctions.\n\nOne can attend the whole conference, one day, or selected lectures. Five\npeople can attend the whole conference for the price of four.\nRegistration is available online at www.iands.org.---Or by calling\n860.882.1211, the national headquarters of IANDS in Hartford, CT.\nBrochures will also be available through Chicago IANDS: 847.251.5758.\n\nWELCOME TO CHICAGO!\n\nChicago IANDS is getting ready to welcome YOU to the windy city! We have\nbeen working hard to organize the best IANDS conference ever with\nfabulous speakers and entertainers whose creativity blossomed after\ntheir near-death experiences. We have reserved a beautiful little hotel\nabout five blocks from Lake Michigan, which will make it possible to\nwalk along the beach early in the morning and watch the sun rise over\nthe water.\n\nThe hotel rooms are lovely, with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows\nwith a view of either the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan ---or\nEvanston and Lake Michigan. The hotel is located in the center of\nEvanston, IL, a block from the elevated train, on which one can ride\nfrom O\\'Hare or Midway airports, or anywhere in the city, for only\n$1.80. Outside of the hotel, the Evanston Art Fair will be in full swing\non Saturday and Sunday---a perfect setting for our conference theme:\n\\"Creativity from the Light.\\"\n\nEvanston boasts some of the best restaurants in the Chicagoland area,\nmost at very reasonable prices, and many within a few blocks of the\nhotel. There are galleries and museums, and even the Kohl Children\\'s\nMuseum is in the area. It will be easy to have a great time in Evanston\nif that is your sole destination.\n\nHowever....if you are blessed with a few extra days or can spend your\nvacation in the area, you can take advantage of one of the most\nbeautiful cities in the world: Chicago. There isn\\'t room to even begin\nto list all there is to do in Chicago, which is about 30 minutes (12\nmiles) south of Evanston. Some of my favorites places are the Art\nInstitute, the Field Museum of Natural History, and Navy Pier, an\namusement pier which extends into Lake Michigan beneath Oprah Winfrey\\'s\napartment windows. Navy Pier\\'s enormous Ferris wheel is also a great\nway to see the city. And there are riverboat rides down the Chicago\nRiver through the heart of the city, two zoos, the\\"miraculous mile\\"---\na shopper\\'s paradise, and the American Girl\\'s store, which all girls\nof any age will enjoy. And don\\'t forget the Museum of Science and\nIndustry, the Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planatarium!\n\nThe ethnic communities alone would make the trip worthwhile. You can go\nto Vietnam, Poland, China, Sweden, and many other countries---right\nhere. Chicago has more Poles than Warsaw! Second City and other theater\ngroups abound, and Ravinia, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony\nOrchestra is a very special outdoor experience. The beach, the parks,\nthe opportunities are endless....\n\nThat\\'s the setting....all we need is you!\n\n---Diane Willis, Facilitator, Chicago IANDS\n\nRegister now for the next [IANDS North American Conference!][1] The\nfirst 200 registrants also receive a free copy of Andy Lakey\\'s\nbeautiful $30 book, *Art, Angels and Miracles,* which will be\ndistributed at the conference check-in desk.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.iands.org/conf.html \n	2004-06-24	2011-08-06 03:42:26.549363	2011-11-11 03:02:14.128742	<p><tt> Three whole days of fabulous speakers!

This\nvery common phenomenon brings not only tangible, creative gifts, but\nalso spiritual ones: an ability to view the world from a higher\nperspective, a greater sense of peace, more understanding of the nature\nof the the Universe, a connection to a higher power, and a loss of fear\nof dying.</p>\n\n<p>IANDS will bring from England, Peter Fenwick, M.D., an internationally\nknown neuropsychiatrist who is one of the world\\&#39;s leading NDE\nresearchers; California artist, Andy Lakey, whose stunning angel\npaintings now fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars, and who had never\npainted before his NDE; Talented medical intuitive and NDEr, Caroline\nSutherland, from Vancouver, B.C.; and NDEr, comedienne and intuitive,\nDonna McCue, from Long Island, NY.</p>\n\n<p>Thirty-two more speakers include well-known NDE researcher, PMH Atwater,\nUniversity of Illinois&#47;Chicago professors, Steve Fanning (History) and\nNeal Grossman (Philosophy), Jungian psychologist Dr. Robert Moretti,\ndiscussing Jung\\&#39;s two NDEs; psychologist Dr. Allan Botkin, After-Death\nCommunications (ADCs); Evanston internist, Dr. Robert Magrisso,\nwell-known Chicago minister, Rev.

We have\nbeen working hard to organize the best IANDS conference ever with\nfabulous speakers and entertainers whose creativity blossomed after\ntheir near-death experiences. We have reserved a beautiful little hotel\nabout five blocks from Lake Michigan, which will make it possible to\nwalk along the beach early in the morning and watch the sun rise over\nthe water.</p>\n\n<p>The hotel rooms are lovely, with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows\nwith a view of either the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan &mdash;or\nEvanston and Lake Michigan. The hotel is located in the center of\nEvanston, IL, a block from the elevated train, on which one can ride\nfrom O\\&#39;Hare or Midway airports, or anywhere in the city, for only\n$1.80. Outside of the hotel, the Evanston Art Fair will be in full swing\non Saturday and Sunday&mdash;a perfect setting for our conference theme:\n&ldquo;Creativity from the Light.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Evanston boasts some of the best restaurants in the Chicagoland area,\nmost at very reasonable prices, and many within a few blocks of the\nhotel. There are galleries and museums, and even the Kohl Children\\&#39;s\nMuseum is in the area. It will be easy to have a great time in Evanston\nif that is your sole destination.</p>\n\n<p>However&hellip;.if you are blessed with a few extra days or can spend your\nvacation in the area, you can take advantage of one of the most\nbeautiful cities in the world: Chicago. There isn\\&#39;t room to even begin\nto list all there is to do in Chicago, which is about 30 minutes (12\nmiles) south of Evanston. Some of my favorites places are the Art\nInstitute, the Field Museum of Natural History, and Navy Pier, an\namusement pier which extends into Lake Michigan beneath Oprah Winfrey\\&#39;s\napartment windows. Navy Pier\\&#39;s enormous Ferris wheel is also a great\nway to see the city. And there are riverboat rides down the Chicago\nRiver through the heart of the city, two zoos, the&quot;miraculous mile&quot;&mdash;\na shopper\\&#39;s paradise, and the American Girl\\&#39;s store, which all girls\nof any age will enjoy. And don\\&#39;t forget the Museum of Science and\nIndustry, the Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planatarium!</p>\n\n<p>The ethnic communities alone would make the trip worthwhile. You can go\nto Vietnam, Poland, China, Sweden, and many other countries&mdash;right\nhere. Chicago has more Poles than Warsaw! Second City and other theater\ngroups abound, and Ravinia, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony\nOrchestra is a very special outdoor experience. The beach, the parks,\nthe opportunities are endless&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>That\\&#39;s the setting&hellip;.all we need is you!</p>\n\n<p>&mdash;Diane Willis, Facilitator, Chicago IANDS</p>\n\n<p>Register now for the next <a href="http://www.iands.org/conf.html">IANDS North American Conference!</a> The\nfirst 200 registrants also receive a free copy of Andy Lakey\\&#39;s\nbeautiful $30 book, <em>Art, Angels and Miracles,</em> which will be\ndistributed at the conference check-in desk.</p>\n	f

58	Guest Speakers:  Catherine Chiesa and Jack Bonczyk	Near-Death Experiencers from our own group, Chicago IANDS, will tell their stories and discuss them with the audience.	Jack Bonczyk, 53, had his NDE in 1972 as a result of having a car fall\non him, which broke his spinal column. He had been under the car,\npreparing it for an interview with Hot Rod magazine. One of the supports\ncollapsed and the car fell on Jack. He was taken to the hospital, had\nsurgery, and was expected to die. After the operation. he flatlined for\nabout 4 minutes. While the medical team feverishly worked to revive him,\nJack woke up in the corner of the room watching them, listening to the\ntalk about what they were going to do. \\" I suddenly realized I was in\nthe corner watching them and I was the one in bed. \\" \n\n \\"The next thing I knew I was falling down a well shaft. At first I\ntried to stop myself. I saw bright light and I realized I was dying. I\nknew I was headed to a soft and comfortable place. And I knew everything\nwould be fine. I let go and started to fall faster. Looking back was\nhorrible---the world is filled with such mean people. Meanwhile I\ndropped for what seemed like four hours. I woke up in the hospital room,\nthree days later. \\" \n\n Jack was in the hospital for two years. Initially, he was paralyzed\nfrom the chest down, but while in the hospital, he learned how to talk\nto the cells in his body and gradually released the paralysis. After\nseven years of working on this, he had released the paralysis down to\nthe mid-calf. He still wears braces on both ankles so he can walk. He is\nnow a commercial airline pilot. \n\n Catherine Chiesa, 69, is the mother of three (one deceased) and\ngrandmother of five. In 1957, as she was about to deliver her first\nchild, she suddenly found herself \\"way far out\\" in a bright\nilluminated tunnel. \\"It was effervescent---so beautiful and peaceful.\nThe feeling of being completely safe ---and HOME.

66	Guest Speaker:  Sonia Choquette	Spiritual Teacher, Intuitive, Author, talks about her NDE and other spiritual experiences.	Sonia Choquette is a world-renowned psychic, intuitive and spiritual\nteacher who specializes in helping others recognize that we are all\nendowed with a sixth sense that we can count on and need to activate in\norder to succeed in our lives. Blessed with a gift for presenting\nspiritual material in an easily unstandable package, Sonia draws upon\nmany up-lifting stories from her life experiences to illustrate the\nlessons which she so successfully teaches.\n\nA masterful guide committed to strengthening intuition in our daily\nlives, she is the best-selling author of seven books: *The Psychic\nPathway* (Three Rivers Press), *Your Heart\\'s Desire* (Three Rivers\nPress), *The Wise Child* (Three Rivers Press), *True Balance* (Three\nRivers Press), *Your Psychic Pathway to New Beginnings* (Clarkson\nPotter/ Publishers, July 2002), *Your Psychic Pathway to Joy* (Clarkson\nPotter Publishers, July 2002), *The Diary of a Psychic* (Hay\nHouse/Publishers July 2003), and numerous audio editions. Her\nbestselling books have been published in more than 23 countries.\n\nHighly trained in the Psychic Arts and Metaphysical Law, with extensive\nbackground in the mysticism of East and West, Sonia was educated at the\nUniversity of Denver and at the Sorbonne in Paris, and holds a Ph.D. in\nMetaphysics from the American Institute of Holistic Theology.\n\nSonia says, \\"I am intuitive because I was encouraged at all times to be\nawake, aware and guided by my sixth sense. I grew up in an environment\nthat treated intuition not only as natural but actually essential to\nsuccessful navigation in life. Intuition is a gift that we all have,\nthat we can all experience, that we can all trust and that we all\nneed!\\"\n\nIn working with people for more than 32 years of almost daily one-on-one\nprivate consultations, Sonia insists that the sixth sense is natural to\nus all. Whether it\\'s those \\"hunches\\" or \\"feelings\\" or \\"vibes\\",\neveryone has them, but unfortunately most people dismiss or ignore them\nand sadly miss the benefits. With the onset of the changing world we now\nlive in, Sonia emphasizes that using our intuition is \\"no longer\noptional.

Blessed with a gift for presenting\nspiritual material in an easily unstandable package, Sonia draws upon\nmany up-lifting stories from her life experiences to illustrate the\nlessons which she so successfully teaches.</p>\n\n<p>A masterful guide committed to strengthening intuition in our daily\nlives, she is the best-selling author of seven books: <em>The Psychic\nPathway</em> (Three Rivers Press), <em>Your Heart\\&#39;s Desire</em> (Three Rivers\nPress), <em>The Wise Child</em> (Three Rivers Press), <em>True Balance</em> (Three\nRivers Press), <em>Your Psychic Pathway to New Beginnings</em> (Clarkson\nPotter&#47; Publishers, July 2002), <em>Your Psychic Pathway to Joy</em> (Clarkson\nPotter Publishers, July 2002), <em>The Diary of a Psychic</em> (Hay\nHouse&#47;Publishers July 2003), and numerous audio editions. Her\nbestselling books have been published in more than 23 countries.</p>\n\n<p>Highly trained in the Psychic Arts and Metaphysical Law, with extensive\nbackground in the mysticism of East and West, Sonia was educated at the\nUniversity of Denver and at the Sorbonne in Paris, and holds a Ph.D. in\nMetaphysics from the American Institute of Holistic Theology.</p>\n\n<p>Sonia says, \\&ldquo;I am intuitive because I was encouraged at all times to be\nawake, aware and guided by my sixth sense. I grew up in an environment\nthat treated intuition not only as natural but actually essential to\nsuccessful navigation in life. Intuition is a gift that we all have,\nthat we can all experience, that we can all trust and that we all\nneed!\\&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In working with people for more than 32 years of almost daily one-on-one\nprivate consultations, Sonia insists that the sixth sense is natural to\nus all. Whether it\\&#39;s those \\&ldquo;hunches\\&rdquo; or \\&ldquo;feelings\\&rdquo; or \\&ldquo;vibes\\&rdquo;,\neveryone has them, but unfortunately most people dismiss or ignore them\nand sadly miss the benefits. With the onset of the changing world we now\nlive in, Sonia emphasizes that using our intuition is \\&ldquo;no longer\noptional. Working with and strengthening our intuition is becoming more\nand more fundamental to our ability to live harmoniously with ourselves\nand others in the new world order.\\&rdquo; Sonia also speaks and conducts\nworkshops around the globe.</p>\n\n<p>Sonia has been a guest on ABC, NBC, CNN, The Wisdom Channel, and WGN as\nwell as featured in New Woman Magazine (where they rated <em>Your Heart\\&#39;s\nDesire</em> as one of the 10 best courses to change your life), New Age\nMagazine, USA Today, Body, Mind and Soul, Chicago Tribune, and Crain\\&#39;s\nChicago Business Journal.

74	Guest Speaker:   Thomas Gates	Back by popular demand!   Healer, known for successful group  and individual healings, will tell about his NDE and do an extensive group healing.   	Thomas Gates was born in Texas in 1950 and was the fourth of five\nchildren. He grew up in the rural countryside not far from Dallas, where\nhe and his brothers and sisters attended Catholic school. His father was\na fireman, and his loving mother was a homemaker and the quiet spiritual\nleader of the family. At the age of twelve he began working as a\nprofessional musician and soon became an accomplished drummer.\n\n<P> He spent much of his childhood playing in the woods, observing the stars, the sky, the trees, the animals, the changing of seasons, and the effortless flow of nature�s way. As a result he sensed that there must be one simple and powerful essence sustaining all this incredibly diverse creation. <P> Then, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Thomas learned Transcendental Meditation. This brought the experience of the underlying wholeness of all creation and confirmed his sense of what had been occurring in nature all along. This euphoria lasted about one week when he suddenly found himself being rushed to the hospital with a case of appendicitis. <P> Thomas found himself in what appeared to be a losing battle for his life. Soon after the surgery, he heard the doctors announce to his father, "We're sorry. We've done everything we can. You should know that he might not mike it." Within moments Thomas began an amazing and graceful journey all the way through and beyond the "light" to the underlying, eternal source of his own existence and that of all creation. <P> As the universe began to unfold before him, he experienced and understood many things about our creation. He encountered a magnificent golden light and was completely absorbed by its powerful, healing warmth. The greatest gift was the confirmation that we are all eternal and inseparable from our source, from one another, or from any other particle of the universe. This experience forever changed his perception and understanding of life as he began a new journey back into the realm of human existence. <P> As he began to share his story with others, walking them through the journey, Thomas became aware that there appeared to be some subtle healing value experienced by those with whom he shared. It seems to bring a greater sense of peace and increasing freedom from some underlying fears without specifically addressing any particular fears. Fear is an illusion created by the belief and the resulting experience that we are separate from the source of our whole ness and its presence in all points of creation. With the spontaneous collapse of fear more wholeness is revealed. This can bring into our lives more than just the memory of who we really are but, in fact, the experience of who we really are. <P> Thomas was given the gift to draw from that same brilliant, golden light he had encountered in his journey which brings spectrums that enliven the body�s natural physical and emotional healing process. The spectrums not only facilitate pain relief but also help release the underlying remnants of trauma in the physiology that give rise to physical and emotional dysfunction. <P> "Thomas Gates is an exceptional speaker with an extraordinary message. The story of his profound near-death experience conveys a deep sense of peace and an understanding of the eternal connection that we all have to one another." --Loni Parrott, Founder and Facilitator, Iowa City, IA IANDS <P> "I had just hurt my ankle and was limping badly when I had a session with Thomas. I immediately began to feel heat in the ankle and then a soothing coolness as the pain disappeared. After the session I stood up and walked without any pain whatsoever. I never had a problem with it again." --MM, Fairfield, IA, Consultant <P>Further information can be obtained from [ *www.destinationwholeness.com*][1] </P></P></P></P></P></P></P></P></P>\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.destinationwholeness.com \n	2005-08-13	2011-08-06 03:42:26.850461	2011-11-11 03:02:14.521624	<p>Thomas Gates was born in Texas in 1950 and was the fourth of five\nchildren.

Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, Atwater married young and became a mother of\nthree, Sunday School teacher, secretary, and prize winning cook. A\nhandwriting analysis in the mid-sixties led to a complete career and\nlife-style change. She was redirected into public service and innovative\nproject development and analysis. Paralleling this change she began\nintensive research into paranormal and altered states of consciousness.\n\nWith a professional background in hypnotic past-life regressions,\nsensitivity work, dehaunting houses, and mediumship, she came to\nspecialize in aura massage, astrology, numerology, dream and symbol\ninterpretation, rune casting, divinatory and earth energy sensing.\n\n1977 set the stage for severe health traumas resulting in death and the\nnear-death phenomenon, three times in three months. The following year,\nin an effort to understand what had happened to her and was still\nhappening, she began to seek out and interview other near-death\nsurvivors. Her initial findings about the aftereffects of near-death\nwere published in Vital Signs magazine, 1981-85, and later became\n\\"COMING BACK TO LIFE: THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE\\"\n(hardcover 1988 Dodd Mead & Co., paperback 1989 Ballantine Books,\nsoftcover, Citadel Press). After over fifteen years of intensive\nresearch, speaking with or interviewing over 3,000 near-death survivors,\nher book \\"BEYOND THE LIGHT, WHAT ISN\\'T BElNG SAlD ABOUT THE NEAR-DEATH\nEXPERlENCE\\" (hard cover 1994 Birch Lane Press, paperback 1995 Avon\nBooks) represents the most complete compendium yet done of the\nphenomenon, its aftereffects and implications (Its sequel: \\"FUTURE\nMEMORY,\\" Birch Lane Press 1996, paperback edition from Hampton Roads\nPublishing).\n\nAn international authority on near-death states, she has served two\nterms on the Board of the International Association for Near-Death\nStudies. Her book, \\"CHILDREN OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM,\\" a major study of\nchild experiencers of near-death states, came out August 1999 from Three\nRivers Press. It was then enlarged and rewritten as THE NEW CHILDREN AND\nNEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES (Inner Traditions/Bear & Co., 2003). With the\nhelp of David Morgan, she produced the world\\'s first positive/negative,\n360-degree compendium of the entire near-death phenomenon. Titled \\"THE\nCOMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES,\\" this 480-page\nMacmillan edition debuted March/April, 2000. Atwater has received\nnumerous awards during her life. Her biography is in sixteen Who\\'s Who\nBooks, half of them international editions. Her latest book is BEYOND\nTHE INDIGO CHILDREN: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World.\n\nSome of her findings have now been clinically verified in prospective\nstudies, the latest in \\"The Lancet\\" medical journal 12-15-01, in the\npaper by Pim van Lommel, a Dutch cardiologist. She has lectured twice at\nthe United Nations and at many other gatherings, large and small. Her\nwritings have appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers.

93	Guest Speaker:  Joyce Hawkes, Ph.D.	Bio-physicist, NDEr, Healer---from Seattle. 	A passionate and productive scientist, student, mystic, teacher and\nhealer, Dr Joyce Hawkes is internationally recognized for her work as a\nresearch scientist and her more recent work as a teacher of Cell-Level\nhealing. Her early work on the biophysics of cell structure and function\nincluded a position as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National\nInstitutes of Health. She published nearly 50 papers, abstracts, and\nbook chapters. The innovative excellence of her research earned her\nelection to the position of Fellow in the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, a position which she maintains presently.\n\nFollowing a near-death experience she changed careers in 1984 and\nembarked on an extensive exploration of spiritual and healing\ntraditions. Recognized on first sight by her indigenous teachers as\nauthentically and exceptionally gifted, she was invited into the native\ncultures of healing wisdom by those who had not previously taken Western\nstudents. Nearly three months living in the Philippines and work with a\nnative healer preceded her exploration of additional SE Asian healing\npractices. A month long stay in South India and six trips to Bali to\nwork intensively with two native Hindu priest/shamans immersed her in\nEastern philosophy, remote village life, and first-hand experience of\nnumerous practical applications of indigenous healing modalities.\n\nWith twenty two years experience working as a spiritual counselor,\nhealer, and seminar leader in Seattle, in other US cities, and abroad,\nJoyce combines her rigorous background as a scientist and her compassion\nas a healer in her presentations and writing. Her book: *Cell-Level\nHealing. The Bridge from Soul to Cell (Oct 2006)* demonstrates effective\nways to harmonize spirituality and Western science. A popular seminar\nleader and conference presenter, she has also appeared on radio: Coast\nto Coast in the US and Canada; on local, national, and international TV;\nand at major global conferences to speak about her insights and\nsuccessful applications of Cell-Level healing for optimal health.\n\nReviews of Joyce\\'s new book: *Cell-Level Healing. The Bridge from Soul\nto Cell (Oct 2006)*\n\n“Cell-Level Healing is a remarkable bridge between conventional cell\nbiology and the far reaches of self and spiritual healing. Dr. Hawkes\nskillfully combines her solid scientific grounding and experience in\nmainstream biophysics with personal insights gained from a near death\nexperience and extensive training in the alternative healing arts.\nHawkes beautifully demonstrates how science and spirituality can\npeacefully coexist and inform each other in beneficial and refreshing\nways.” —Dean Radin PhD, Senior Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences\n\n“Cell-Level Healing is quite simply the whole exciting truth about how\nand why our consciousness is key to our physical health and well-being.”\n—Christiane Northrup, M. D., author of Mother-Daughter Wisdom, The\nWisdom of Menopause, and Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom\n\n“A remarkable book. Cell-Level Healing provides the reader with a poetic\nand visual text on self-healing and demonstrates how science and\nspirituality need not be opponents but can serve as allies in the\nreader’s transformation. Dr. Joyce Hawkes has created a delightful\nuser-friendly volume that can be read, savored, and re-read—one that is\nboth simple and profound.” —Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Saybrook Graduate\nSchool and Research Center; co-editor of Varieties of Anomalous\nExperience; and author of Extraordinary Dreams and How to Work with Them\n\n“Science and spirit are brought together with beauty and discernment in\nthis exquisite book. Joyce Hawkes offers us a vision of healing that\ntruly manages to bridge worlds which only remain separate at our peril.\n‘The Bridge from Soul to Cell’ is more than a good metaphor: it links\nwisdom and science and by doing so opens the way for great healing.”\n—James O’Dea, president, Institute of Noetic Sciences\n\n“Joyce Hawkes blends and makes whole our splintered perceptions of the\nroles of science and spirit in healing. Her beautiful vision of how\ncells house the very power of the universe, speaks to a greater\nunderstanding and the interconnectedness of the spiritual in the\nphysical. In this broader understanding, Joyce bridges the gulf between\nthe tangible and the intangible. She offers up the potential for\nself-healing, always waiting within us. Her book is both art and science\nfor healing” —Joan C. King, Ph. D., professor emerita at Tufts\nUniversity School of Medicine, author of the Cellular Wisdom series\n\n“The intrinsic nature of our being is primordially pure, luminous\nawareness—and mind and body are the unified expression of that reality.\nDr. Hawkes’s insightful work brings a depth of scientific knowledge\ntogether with the tools for applying that understanding in a way that\nrelieves suffering and promotes spiritual awareness. Cell-Level Healing\nsheds welcome light on the interdependence of our inner and outer\nworlds. It provides practical guidance for working with the challenges\nof illness while supporting our journey of personal transformation.\n—Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, founder and president of Nalandabodhi and\nNitartha International, author of Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra\nand Dzogchen\n\nFor more info, visit her web site: [ *www.joycehawkes.com*][1]\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.joycehawkes.com \n	2007-03-10	2011-08-06 03:42:27.34995	2011-11-11 03:02:14.945369	<p>A passionate and productive scientist, student, mystic, teacher and\nhealer, Dr Joyce Hawkes is internationally recognized for her work as a\nresearch scientist and her more recent work as a teacher of Cell-Level\nhealing.

Dr. Joyce Hawkes has created a delightful\nuser-friendly volume that can be read, savored, and re-read—one that is\nboth simple and profound.” —Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Saybrook Graduate\nSchool and Research Center; co-editor of Varieties of Anomalous\nExperience; and author of Extraordinary Dreams and How to Work with Them</p>\n\n<p>“Science and spirit are brought together with beauty and discernment in\nthis exquisite book. Joyce Hawkes offers us a vision of healing that\ntruly manages to bridge worlds which only remain separate at our peril.\n‘The Bridge from Soul to Cell’ is more than a good metaphor: it links\nwisdom and science and by doing so opens the way for great healing.”\n—James O’Dea, president, Institute of Noetic Sciences</p>\n\n<p>“Joyce Hawkes blends and makes whole our splintered perceptions of the\nroles of science and spirit in healing. Her beautiful vision of how\ncells house the very power of the universe, speaks to a greater\nunderstanding and the interconnectedness of the spiritual in the\nphysical. In this broader understanding, Joyce bridges the gulf between\nthe tangible and the intangible. She offers up the potential for\nself-healing, always waiting within us. Her book is both art and science\nfor healing” —Joan C. King, Ph. D., professor emerita at Tufts\nUniversity School of Medicine, author of the Cellular Wisdom series</p>\n\n<p>“The intrinsic nature of our being is primordially pure, luminous\nawareness—and mind and body are the unified expression of that reality.\nDr. Hawkes’s insightful work brings a depth of scientific knowledge\ntogether with the tools for applying that understanding in a way that\nrelieves suffering and promotes spiritual awareness. Cell-Level Healing\nsheds welcome light on the interdependence of our inner and outer\nworlds. It provides practical guidance for working with the challenges\nof illness while supporting our journey of personal transformation.\n—Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, founder and president of Nalandabodhi and\nNitartha International, author of Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra\nand Dzogchen</p>\n\n<p>For more info, visit her web site: <a href="http://www.joycehawkes.com"> <em><a href="http://www.joycehawkes.com">www.joycehawkes.com</a></em></a></p>\n	t

A clinical social worker, Sharp has taught at the University of Washington School of Medicine and at Seattle University. She lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband and daughter. Her book,<i> After the Light,</i> is a near-death classic, educating\nthousands about the near-death experience with much humor and tact,\ndelivering the serious message that we do not die in an irresistibly\nhumorous package.

Three Films outlining the use of Meditation in Prisons:\nDoing Time, Doing Vipassana,\nChanging From Inside,\nFreedom Behind Bars	Repeat of last month\\'s videos for those unable to make it last month.\nOutstanding films. Do not miss this opportunity!\n\nDOING TIME, DOING VIPASSANA (52 minutes)\n\nIn the mid-1970s Vipassana was first tried within a prison environment\nwith two 10 day courses being conducted for jail officials and inmates\nof a prison in Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Despite the\nsuccess of those courses, no further jail courses were conducted in\nIndia for almost 20 years. In 1993 a new Inspector General of Indian\nprisons, Kiran Bedi, was appointed and in the process of trying to\nreform the harsh Indian penal system, learned of the earlier Vipassana\ncourses. She requested that additional courses be conducted in the\nlargest prison in India, Tihar Jail outside of New Delhi. The results\nwere dramatically sucessful. Based upon the success of these courses,\nanother course was conducted in April 1994 by Goenkaji and a number of\nhis assistant teachers for over one thousand inmates of Tihar prison\nwith wonderful benefit for all of those who participated.\n\nDuring the following winter of 1994-95, the Israeli filmmakers traveled\nto both Tihar and to the Baroda Jail in the India state of Gujarat, at\nwhich Vipassana courses had also been conducted. There they conducted\nand filmed extensive interviews with jail officials, including Karen\nBedei, and inmates from many different countries who participated in the\ncourses. The result of these efforts was an extremely powerful 52-minute\ndocumentary film entitled Doing Time, Doing Vipassana. The film\ndescribes the way in which Vipassana has been sucessfully used within\nthe Indian prison system to dramatically change the behaviour and\nattitude of the inmates and jailers who participated in the courses and,\nthereby, improve the entire atmosphere of the prisons.\n\n*Doing Time, Doing Vipassana* has been broadcast in many diverse\ninternational markets including the following stations and networks: PBS\n- USA; NHK - Japan; YLE - Finland; TSI - Switzerland; DR TV - Denmark;\nChannel 8 - Israel; and TV Poland.

DOING TIME, DOING VIPASSANA (52 minutes)</p>\n\n<p>In the mid-1970s Vipassana was first tried within a prison environment\nwith two 10 day courses being conducted for jail officials and inmates\nof a prison in Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Despite the\nsuccess of those courses, no further jail courses were conducted in\nIndia for almost 20 years. In 1993 a new Inspector General of Indian\nprisons, Kiran Bedi, was appointed and in the process of trying to\nreform the harsh Indian penal system, learned of the earlier Vipassana\ncourses. She requested that additional courses be conducted in the\nlargest prison in India, Tihar Jail outside of New Delhi. The results\nwere dramatically sucessful. Based upon the success of these courses,\nanother course was conducted in April 1994 by Goenkaji and a number of\nhis assistant teachers for over one thousand inmates of Tihar prison\nwith wonderful benefit for all of those who participated.</p>\n\n<p>During the following winter of 1994-95, the Israeli filmmakers traveled\nto both Tihar and to the Baroda Jail in the India state of Gujarat, at\nwhich Vipassana courses had also been conducted. There they conducted\nand filmed extensive interviews with jail officials, including Karen\nBedei, and inmates from many different countries who participated in the\ncourses. The result of these efforts was an extremely powerful 52-minute\ndocumentary film entitled Doing Time, Doing Vipassana. The film\ndescribes the way in which Vipassana has been sucessfully used within\nthe Indian prison system to dramatically change the behaviour and\nattitude of the inmates and jailers who participated in the courses and,\nthereby, improve the entire atmosphere of the prisons.</p>\n\n<p><em>Doing Time, Doing Vipassana</em> has been broadcast in many diverse\ninternational markets including the following stations and networks: PBS\n- USA; NHK - Japan; YLE - Finland; TSI - Switzerland; DR TV - Denmark;\nChannel 8 - Israel; and TV Poland. The film also recently won the\nprestigeous Golden Spire Award at the 1998 San Franisco International\nFilm Festival. The Festival\\&#39;s management wrote as follows about the\njury\\&#39;s decision:</p>\n\n<p>\\&#39;In giving <em>Doing Time, Doing Vipassana</em> its top honour, the jury for\nthe category stated:</p>\n\n<p>\\&ldquo;The jury was moved by this insightful and poignant exposition on\nVipassana. The teaching of this meditation as a transformation device\nhas many implications for people everywhere, providing the cultural,\nsocial and political institutions can embrace and support its liberating\npossibility.\\&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This year\\&#39;s Golden Gate awards competition was incredibly strong &amp;\nclose, as we had a over 1600 entries from 58 countries in the 35\ncategories.\\&#39;</p>\n\n<p>DTDV most recently won a \\&ldquo;Silver Plaque\\&rdquo; award in the INTERCOM - The\nInternational Communications Film &amp; Video Competition, in Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>The film also received an award in 1999 from the American National\nCouncil on Crime &amp; Delinquency (\\&ldquo;NCCD\\&rdquo;). NCCD wrote as follows about\nits decision to present this award:</p>\n\n<p>\\&#39;Congratulations! I am pleased to inform you that you are a recipient\nof the NCCD PASS Awards. The National Council on Crime &amp; Delinquency is\nhonored to recognize your excellence in communicating the complex\nproblems of crime to the American people. We hope this award will serve\nas a contact reminder that your work can make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>A distinguished panel of experts found your work, <em>\\&ldquo;Doing Time, Doing\nVipassana\\&rdquo;</em>, to be worthy of recognition and deserving of special\nacclaim.

116	Guest Speaker:  Lisa Stuckel	Near-Death Experiences from seven major brain surgeries and two strokes, profoundly changed a young woman into a dedicated volunteer who now changes others' lives. 	While she was a college student at U of I in Champaign-Urbana, after she\nexperienced lots of migraine headaches and seizures, Lisa Stuckel was\ntold that she had an Arterio-Venous Malformation (AVM). This problem is\ngenetic, but Lisa didn’t want to deal with it because she thought, “I\nhave my fantastic life, and I do not want anything to stand in my way.”\nIn 1990, in her late 20s, she finally elected to have brain surgery to\ncorrect the AVM.\n\nBefore 1990, Lisa thought she had it all. She calls it her 1st life. She\nhad a fantastic career. She was the Regional Manager of ten Carson Pirie\nScott stores in Illinois and Wisconsin. She also started her own\nsuccessful jewelry design business, called “Box Barge.” She had “the\nmost perfect boyfriend” who, like Lisa, had a creative career, was\nphysically active, with a supportive family and lots of friends. And,\nright before her medical trauma, Lisa had just purchased a brand new\nChrysler LeBaron.\n\nLater in her twenties, Lisa’s seizures started to get much more frequent\nand escalated to much more intense, grand mal seizures. She thought\neventually she might die from them, or that she might kill someone in\nher car if she ever had a seizure while driving. She knew she could not\ncontinue to live with that pressure anymore.\n\nIn 1988, with her father and her neurologist, they researched to find\nthe best neurosurgeon in the country. She flew to several cities to meet\nthe doctors and to look at their hospitals. She chose Dr. Robert\nSpetzler, a neurosurgeon from St. Joseph\\'s Hospital in Phoenix,\nArizona, at the Barrow Neurological Institute. When she met him and\nlooked at his hospital, she felt it all clicked for her. She thought she\nwould have brain surgery, a couple of months of therapy, and then she\nwould be back at work. However, on a scale of 1-5, and 5 being the worst\nand largest malformation, Lisa had a 5. Also, Dr Spetzler did warn Lisa\nthat strokes are a risk factor with this type of surgery, but that\ndidn’t deter her. She knew she had to do it.\n\nDr. Spetzler realized that because the malformation was so large, he\nwould have to operate on it a small section at a time. So, all together,\nLisa suffered 2 strokes during 7 brain surgeries!! For a while she was\nin a drug-induced coma and she only had a 50/50 chance of living. When\nshe started to recover, she was paralyzed on her whole left side, she\nwas blind, she could not walk, talk or even dress herself. Everyone\nlooked at her as if she was a baby, starting over again! Lisa’s family\nwas told that Lisa would never again live on her own. It was a\ndevastating time in her still young life.\n\nLisa felt that through the power from the Beings Up Above, through\nexcellent doctors, through a fabulous therapist, and maybe most\nimportant, through the Power Within, she utilized the true keys to\nrecovery.\n\nAfter Lisa\\'s medical madness, she lost her first life! She lost her\ncareer, her boyfriend, her car, her apartment, her sense of humor, some\nof her memory and even her personality! She also lost some close\nrelationships that she used to have from brothers, sisters and friends.\nLisa was depressed in the beginning of her recovery, only to realize\nthat the depression was only hindering her from getting better faster.\nThe key that she felt helped her the most, was recognition of the\nFIGHTER within herself. Through hard work during therapies, through\npositive thinking, through the power of prayer…..who knows how far we\ncan soar? Even though most of her doctors told her that she would\nrecover in about 12 years, her recovery has been almost 20 years, and\nshe feels that she is still recovering. She always thinks: Do not ever\ngive up!\n\nWhen Lisa was told that she had a 50/50 chance of living, she had a\nSpiritual experience! She will tell you that she was not a perfect\nperson in any way, and she still can not believe that it happened. One\nnight when she was in bed but not sleeping, she saw Jesus! He said to\nher: “You are going to get better, and you will need to help others who\nare going through similar experiences to yours.”\n\nAbout three years after her rehabilitation, she started to volunteer at\nLutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, IL. She volunteers on the 6W\nfloor, the rehabilitation unit helping mostly brain injured, stroke, and\namputee patients. Finally, she realized why she is still here on this\nearth…to help others in recovery. She also volunteers at Marianjoy\nRehabilitation Center in Wheaton, Il, where she was also a patient in\n1990. For a while, in the late 1990s she was also doing volunteer work\nat the American Heart Association and at Alexian Brothers Medical\nCenter.\n\nLisa feels, even though she lost so much of her first life, she gained\n3x more in this 2nd life. Even though she had to start over again, she\nlooks at it as “Thank God I have the opportunity to start over!” She\nalso married a fine, loving man about 5 years ago, and today she is much\nmore dedicated to her health. She exercises and jogs, and sleeps twice\nas much as the old days, because she is so much more organized. She\ndrinks a lot less coffee and alcohol. She even feels she is a better\nperson and her Spiritual side is much stronger. She continues to focus\non the positive things of life, calling them “the keys to health and\nhappiness. “\n\n	2009-02-14	2011-08-06 03:42:27.950916	2011-11-11 03:02:15.684052	<p>While she was a college student at U of I in Champaign-Urbana, after she\nexperienced lots of migraine headaches and seizures, Lisa Stuckel was\ntold that she had an Arterio-Venous Malformation (AVM).

And,\nright before her medical trauma, Lisa had just purchased a brand new\nChrysler LeBaron.</p>\n\n<p>Later in her twenties, Lisa’s seizures started to get much more frequent\nand escalated to much more intense, grand mal seizures. She thought\neventually she might die from them, or that she might kill someone in\nher car if she ever had a seizure while driving. She knew she could not\ncontinue to live with that pressure anymore.</p>\n\n<p>In 1988, with her father and her neurologist, they researched to find\nthe best neurosurgeon in the country. She flew to several cities to meet\nthe doctors and to look at their hospitals. She chose Dr. Robert\nSpetzler, a neurosurgeon from St. Joseph\\&#39;s Hospital in Phoenix,\nArizona, at the Barrow Neurological Institute. When she met him and\nlooked at his hospital, she felt it all clicked for her. She thought she\nwould have brain surgery, a couple of months of therapy, and then she\nwould be back at work. However, on a scale of 1-5, and 5 being the worst\nand largest malformation, Lisa had a 5. Also, Dr Spetzler did warn Lisa\nthat strokes are a risk factor with this type of surgery, but that\ndidn’t deter her. She knew she had to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Spetzler realized that because the malformation was so large, he\nwould have to operate on it a small section at a time. So, all together,\nLisa suffered 2 strokes during 7 brain surgeries!! For a while she was\nin a drug-induced coma and she only had a 50&#47;50 chance of living. When\nshe started to recover, she was paralyzed on her whole left side, she\nwas blind, she could not walk, talk or even dress herself. Everyone\nlooked at her as if she was a baby, starting over again! Lisa’s family\nwas told that Lisa would never again live on her own. It was a\ndevastating time in her still young life.</p>\n\n<p>Lisa felt that through the power from the Beings Up Above, through\nexcellent doctors, through a fabulous therapist, and maybe most\nimportant, through the Power Within, she utilized the true keys to\nrecovery.</p>\n\n<p>After Lisa\\&#39;s medical madness, she lost her first life! She lost her\ncareer, her boyfriend, her car, her apartment, her sense of humor, some\nof her memory and even her personality! She also lost some close\nrelationships that she used to have from brothers, sisters and friends.\nLisa was depressed in the beginning of her recovery, only to realize\nthat the depression was only hindering her from getting better faster.\nThe key that she felt helped her the most, was recognition of the\nFIGHTER within herself. Through hard work during therapies, through\npositive thinking, through the power of prayer…..who knows how far we\ncan soar? Even though most of her doctors told her that she would\nrecover in about 12 years, her recovery has been almost 20 years, and\nshe feels that she is still recovering. She always thinks: Do not ever\ngive up!</p>\n\n<p>When Lisa was told that she had a 50&#47;50 chance of living, she had a\nSpiritual experience! She will tell you that she was not a perfect\nperson in any way, and she still can not believe that it happened. One\nnight when she was in bed but not sleeping, she saw Jesus! He said to\nher: “You are going to get better, and you will need to help others who\nare going through similar experiences to yours.”</p>\n\n<p>About three years after her rehabilitation, she started to volunteer at\nLutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, IL. She volunteers on the 6W\nfloor, the rehabilitation unit helping mostly brain injured, stroke, and\namputee patients. Finally, she realized why she is still here on this\nearth…to help others in recovery. She also volunteers at Marianjoy\nRehabilitation Center in Wheaton, Il, where she was also a patient in\n1990. For a while, in the late 1990s she was also doing volunteer work\nat the American Heart Association and at Alexian Brothers Medical\nCenter.</p>\n\n<p>Lisa feels, even though she lost so much of her first life, she gained\n3x more in this 2nd life. Even though she had to start over again, she\nlooks at it as “Thank God I have the opportunity to start over!” She\nalso married a fine, loving man about 5 years ago, and today she is much\nmore dedicated to her health. She exercises and jogs, and sleeps twice\nas much as the old days, because she is so much more organized. She\ndrinks a lot less coffee and alcohol. She even feels she is a better\nperson and her Spiritual side is much stronger. She continues to focus\non the positive things of life, calling them “the keys to health and\nhappiness. “</p>\n	t
118	Guest Speaker:  Denise Sutherland	NDEr; Angel Therapy Practitioner, Denise gives Angel readings and hosts the Higher Consciousness radio show on WJJG every week.	*From Denise Sutherland\\'s web site:*\n\nBorn a spiritual person, I have had a great interest in the Divine from\nmy toddler years forward. Although my religious upbringing and\nbackground served me well for most of my life, my heart and soul\nexperienced a revival when a few years ago I began studying metaphysics\nand pursing New Age avenues for personal healing. As a result of my\nspiritual study and healing work, my eyes, my arms and my heart have\nbeen opened to now fully embrace the commonality of all faith\ntraditions, and the course has been set for fulfilling my life’s purpose\nwith the help of the angels.\n\nAn aura photo and reading during my time of spiritual transformation\nreintroduced me to the presence of my angels and also to the psychic\nabilities I had shelved as a child long ago. With the help of Dr. Doreen\nVirtue’s Daily Guidance from Your Angels Oracle Cards, I began to\nredevelop my relationship with the angels and to again rely on their\nDivine guidance and wisdom. As my ensemble of angel oracle cards\nincreased, so did my psychic abilities and card-reading proficiency. In\naddition to consulting with the angels for personal guidance, I began\nconducting readings for my family and friends.\n\nThe personal healing and spiritual growth experienced by my family and\nfriends through my angel readings was most rewarding for me. I was\ncertain I wanted to broaden my path as a healer, yet I believed the next\nstep to helping others heal was by teaching hot yoga. Despite distinct\nguidance against this notion from the angels, I enrolled in the\nnine-week yoga training. Within a few days of adhering to the course\nprotocol, my body began to seriously struggle from the extreme heat and\nthe intensity of the training. Even with medical attention and\nsupplementation, my body was incredibly weak and depleted. The voices of\nmy angels spoke loudly to me through my body, frantically urging me to\ndiscontinue the training; yet my ego voice prompted me to push forward\nto completion.\n\nOn the Friday of the sixth week, my organs began to fail from a severe\nsodium and electrolyte imbalance. At the moment of my near-death\nexperience, I was surrounded by many of my fellow trainees whose care\nand attention clearly saved my life. These caring and loving\nindividuals, I soon realized, were my angels intervening on God’s behalf\nto not only spare my life, but to also redirect me to the path of my\nDivine Purpose. As I convalesced the next afternoon, I followed through\nwith the promise of an angel reading for a yoga friend. Looking up from\nmy cards at the completion of her reading, I marveled at the growing\nline of yoga friends also awaiting their personal messages from the\nangels. In that instant, I had a genuine epiphany. Undoubtedly, I was\nbeing guided to be an Angel Therapy Practitioner®.\n\nCertified by Doreen Virtue, Ph.D., www.angeltherapy.com, I am now an\nAngel Therapy Practitioner®, as well as a Kahuna ARCH Healing\nPractitioner certified through ARCH Founder and ARCH Master Teacher,\nLaurie Keako’a’ Grant, www.archhealing.com.

126	Guest Speaker:   Stephen Damroth	NDEr as a result of being murdered by his brother.  Profound story.	Stephen Damroth came from a large Catholic family of 3 girls and 2 boys.\nHis older brother was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic twenty years ago.\nStephen was dyslexic and as a result became more passive and quiet.\nSchool was difficult and although he graduated from high school early,\nhe had a difficult time staying in college because of the learning\ndisability and the financial concerns.\n\nHe was working in a retail store when he was 23, and was sleeping late\non his day off (Friday the 13th, October, 1995) when his brother woke\nhim up around 10:00 am to ask him for a cigarette. He told him he would\ngive him one later. He went back to sleep but was awakened just minutes\nlater to see his brother standing over him with a knife---which was\ndescending. He grabbed the knife blade, but due to his brother’s\nsuperior position and his groggy state, he barely managed to slow the\nblade in its penetration of his chest. They fought as Stephen yelled for\nhelp, but the attack didn’t stop until his mother came to the door to\nreprimand them for fighting.\n\nShocked at the scene, she ran down the hall yelling for her daughter to\ncall 911. By this time his brother had stabbed him four times,\ncompletely severing his subclavian artery and damaging the nerve plexus\nin his shoulder. Blood was literally hosing from his two chest wounds.\nAfter his mothers interruption, his brother stopped and just stood over\nhim, staring blankly....\n\nSo begins the story of Stephen’s extensive Near-Death Experience and the\ncomplete alteration of his life. Starting in the velvety comforting\nblack space and proceeding to the Light, he was aware of love, knowledge\nand connectedness.\n\nTo quote Stephen: “.... I was already well on my way toward forgiving my\nbrother for the stabbing, but when I got to the memory of the Light, any\nbad feelings that I still harbored for him evaporated in that instant.\nIt was like taking a chunk of ice and dropping it into the sun. In an\ninstant, there was not even a wisp of steam remaining of it. As all the\nnegative feelings flashed out of existence from my re-experiencing the\nLight, the vacuum that they left was filled with Love and compassion for\nmy brother and the rest of humanity. At that moment, I was a perfect\nhuman being devoid of flaws as the light burned them away. I was\nphysically only a few days out of my low point when I reached that\nemotional and spiritual high point. From then on, I would never be the\nsame person or see the world and my fellow man in the same way again.\n\nThe influx of memories and grace lasted only a second or two in our\ntime, but their aftereffects are with me still. Within mere seconds I\nwent from being an angry and bitter victim of a terrible crime, to being\na Joyous, Loving, and thankful recipient of the most beautiful and\nwondrous gift.

He told him he would\ngive him one later. He went back to sleep but was awakened just minutes\nlater to see his brother standing over him with a knife&mdash;which was\ndescending. He grabbed the knife blade, but due to his brother’s\nsuperior position and his groggy state, he barely managed to slow the\nblade in its penetration of his chest. They fought as Stephen yelled for\nhelp, but the attack didn’t stop until his mother came to the door to\nreprimand them for fighting.</p>\n\n<p>Shocked at the scene, she ran down the hall yelling for her daughter to\ncall 911. By this time his brother had stabbed him four times,\ncompletely severing his subclavian artery and damaging the nerve plexus\nin his shoulder. Blood was literally hosing from his two chest wounds.\nAfter his mothers interruption, his brother stopped and just stood over\nhim, staring blankly&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>So begins the story of Stephen’s extensive Near-Death Experience and the\ncomplete alteration of his life. Starting in the velvety comforting\nblack space and proceeding to the Light, he was aware of love, knowledge\nand connectedness.</p>\n\n<p>To quote Stephen: “&hellip;. I was already well on my way toward forgiving my\nbrother for the stabbing, but when I got to the memory of the Light, any\nbad feelings that I still harbored for him evaporated in that instant.\nIt was like taking a chunk of ice and dropping it into the sun. In an\ninstant, there was not even a wisp of steam remaining of it. As all the\nnegative feelings flashed out of existence from my re-experiencing the\nLight, the vacuum that they left was filled with Love and compassion for\nmy brother and the rest of humanity. At that moment, I was a perfect\nhuman being devoid of flaws as the light burned them away. I was\nphysically only a few days out of my low point when I reached that\nemotional and spiritual high point. From then on, I would never be the\nsame person or see the world and my fellow man in the same way again.</p>\n\n<p>The influx of memories and grace lasted only a second or two in our\ntime, but their aftereffects are with me still. Within mere seconds I\nwent from being an angry and bitter victim of a terrible crime, to being\na Joyous, Loving, and thankful recipient of the most beautiful and\nwondrous gift. The circumstances hadn\\&#39;t changed, I had.</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after my experience, I was able to see both worlds as if I\nhad on foot in each plane. The spiritual and the physical blended into a\nhomogeneous whole. I could see auras around people and spirits, and I\ncould feel the emotions of others as if they were my own. “</p>\n\n<p>&hellip;Don\\&#39;t miss hearing Stephen\\&#39;s whole story in person.

147	Guest Speaker:  Kenneth W. James, PhD	Jungian Psychoanalyst, will speak on Jung's view of the near-death experience, Asso Spiritualist minister, psychic medium	Ken James is a diplomate Jungian psychoanalyst in private practice in\nChicago, and the founder and director of The Soulwork Center. The\nSoulwork Center is a Jungian-oriented resource center dedicated to\nfacilitating the process of individuation as understood by the\npsychiatrist and philosopher C.G. Jung.\n\nDr. James is also the Director of Student Services at the University of\nChicago Laboratory Schools, where he coordinates all services for\nstudents with learning, emotional and behavioral needs from ages 3 years\nthrough senior year of high school.\n\nIn addition to his psychoanalytic practice, he holds the rank of\nprofessor emeritus after a thirty-three year career as a university\nprofessor. Ken received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1975,\nand his diploma in Analytical Psychology from the C.G. Jung Institute of\nChicago in 1993. Ken did training in The Bonny Method of Guided Imagery\nand Music at the Institute for Consciousness and Music in Baltimore,\nMaryland in the late 1970s. He also did four years of post-doctoral\nstudy in theology and scripture at Catholic Theological Union in\nChicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood in the early 1980s, and ended up\nteaching preaching there for a time.\n\nHe studied vocal music at the American Conservatory of Music, and\nappeared at Zanie’s Comedy Club, Court Theatre, and The Repertory Opera\nTheatre of Oak Park. He also performed flamenco with the Ensemble\nEspañol, under the stage name Francisco Santos. He has served on the\nfaculty at Roosevelt University, Northeastern Illinois University, and\nNorthwestern University. He has lectured and conducted workshops\ninternationally on Divination and Synchronicity, Dream Interpretation,\nand The Tarot and its relationship to Jung’s psychology.\n\nKen’s spirituality draws from several sources. He was raised Roman\nCatholic, but in a “mixed home”—his father was Episcopalian. As he\nmatured, his Catholicism was formed more fully by the Trappists, St.\nFrancis and St. Clare of Assisi, and the Sisters of Saint Agnes. As a\nchild he would go with neighborhood friends to the Chicago Buddhist\nTemple, which at the time was around the corner from his home, and down\nthe street from the Catholic church he attended with his family.\n\nHe took lay ordination as a Zen Buddhist in 1995 under Roshi Richard\nLanglois of the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago. Ken also became familiar\nwith Judaism by attending services occasionally with his godfather’s\nwife, who was Jewish. Later, he studied the Kabbalah with the\nLubavitcher Rabbi Meir Chai Benhiyoun of the Chabad of the Loop, Gold\nCoast and Lincoln Park.\n\nComing from a Scottish family (on his father’s side) with several\ntalented psychics going back several generations, Ken has always been\ncomfortable with the intuitive dimension. He realized that Carl Jung’s\nteachings on the structure and dynamics of the psyche provided grounding\nand clarity on a personal level, and deep professional fulfillment as\nwell. Always eager to learn new things and walk new paths, around ten\nyears ago Ken found his way to the oldest spiritualist church in\nChicago, The Church of the Spirit, where he now serves as an assistant\npastor and medium.\n\nKen’s interest in near-death experiences stems from his practice. Over\nthe past twenty-five years, he has worked with several analysands who\nwere experiencers before they began analysis, and other analysands had\nnear-death experiences during the time that they were doing their\nanalytic work with him. Ken finds that Jung’s psychology lends itself to\na deeper understanding of near-death phenomena, possibly because of\nJung’s own near-death event. Ken is particularly interested in the\nrelationship between near-death experiences, spirituality, Jung\\'s\narchetypes of the collective unconscious, and the practice of\nconsciousness in daily life.\n\nFor more information, please go to: [\n*http://www.soulworkcenter.org/*][1]\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.soulworkcenter.org/ \n	2011-09-10	2011-08-06 03:42:28.721548	2011-11-11 03:02:16.664209	<p>Ken James is a diplomate Jungian psychoanalyst in private practice in\nChicago, and the founder and director of The Soulwork Center.

148	Movies, Movies, Movies 	Raise your vibes with some stunning videos...a wonderful afternoon of mystical fun, both entertaining and informative!\n\n	Two Fabulous Full-length Feature Films. Both of these movies are\nentertaining and informative...Bring your own popcorn...no intermission.\nFirst movie begins promptly at 2 pm.\n\nAt the September 10 Chicago IANDS meeting....130 in attendance...YOU\nchose the two videos to be shown at the next meeting. They are both\nexcellent and hard to find...Amazon had only one copy of Beyond Death\navailable...for $140, and several copies of Experiencing the Soul...for\n$85. So better come to our meeting and see it for a relatively small\ndonation.....\n\nBEYOND DEATH - Mainstream researchers, mediums and those who have had\nnear-death experiences help explore the eternal mystery of what awaits\nus when we die \\*\\*\\*We are all destined to die, and there is no escape.\nBut perhaps it is this inevitability that inspires us to continually\nseek answers to the question: WHAT HAPPENS BEYOND DEATH? This\nfeature-length film explores the eternal enigma from every angle,\nmeeting with everyone from mainstream scientific researchers to mediums\nin search of insight into what is in store for us. Skeptics detail their\narguments. A dramatic and vivid counterpoint is provided by several\npeople who have had near-death experiences, and their extraordinary\ntales are pointed to by others as proof that there is indeed another\nchapter to be written after we pass away. Probing and illuminating, this\nis an extraordinary journey into a realm that has captured the human\nimagination for millennia - the quest for the afterlife.\n\nEXPERIENCING THE SOUL ($65) What is the soul? Although the word is\ndropped into conversation with a clockwork-like regularity, when\npressed, most people struggle to define what they mean when referring to\nthe soul. This compelling program aims to find out how we define the\nsoul, speaking to 18 preeminent leaders in their respective fields of\nscience, teaching, and spirituality, in an attempt to gain a broad\noverview of the subject. Some spooky revelations unfold, as the various\nexperts talk of communicating with the dead, near-death experiences, and\nencounters with as-yet unborn entities. Fleshing out the footage, The\nDalai Lama and other spiritual leaders offer some wise words, making\nthis a fascinating collection of thoughts on an elusive subject.\n\nReviews for Experiencing the Soul from Amazon.com:\n\n1\\. I viewed the film as a rental (in fact, twice in one week, which is\nvery rare for me) and appreciated it so much that I am now buying it.\n\nThis film is a series of people\\'s personal accounts of their real life\nexperiences, not a presentation of a single philosophy or point of view.\nEach person is telling a story of an experience they\\'ve had where they\nhave felt closer to something or someone that could be called the soul\nor spirit, the divine, God, Jesus, a higher power, a different\ndimension, clear light, or however each person chose to express\nthemselves. I found the film to have no particular prejudice or\nreligious leanings, as we hear from Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews,\natheists, a very broad spectrum of religious or spiritual beliefs. In\nfact, one of my favorite aspects of the film is that it provides such a\ndiverse range of perspectives rather than trying to steer us towards\nsome particular belief system.\n\nI couldn\\'t even say that it espouses a firm belief in reincarnation.\nSome of the stories implied this belief, but not all, again representing\na cross section of beliefs. For example, the primary storytellers about\nPre-Birth experiences of the soul were a couple who were so devoutly\nChristian that the mother describes how she is visited by Jesus who\nanswers her prayers by stopping a miscarriage and escorting her unborn\nchild, who has been reluctant to come onto this earth and be born.\n\nWhat particularly attracted me to the film is that it looked at the\nentire cycle of life and how individuals have experienced this at each\nstage: before birth, during their lives, at death, and after death. I\nhave seen and enjoyed several films about Near Death experiences,\nparticularly those by Dr. Raymond Moody, one of the leading researchers\nin Near Death experiences. But this is the first film I have encountered\nthat looks at the whole cycle of life and death.\n\n2\\. I am an avid film buff, viewing 5-7 films a week. Most of them are\nspiritually oriented, or at least inspirational or educational enough\nthat I feel enriched after watching them, rather than simply entertained\n(although it\\'s great if I am also entertained in the process of being\ninspired or educated). So I am quite discriminating about what I\nconsider to be a good film, especially one good enough to buy rather\nthan just rent. And I found this filmmaking to be very well done, with a\nwell-edited blend of these individuals or couples telling their stories,\nbeautiful artwork, an excellent soundtrack, and even some very funny\nmoments. Jean Houston is so funny in telling her stories she could be a\nstand-up comedian, which is what her father wanted her to be anyway\n(it\\'s part of her hilarious stories). The music was so good, that I\\'m\nalso hunting for music by the two soundtrack musicians. There are some\nwell known people telling their stories (Jean Houston, Joan Borysenko,\nRam Das, H.H. The Dalai Lama, etc.) as well as many of us more \\"common\nfolk.\\"\n\nSo I highly recommend this film to people who really want to explore the\npossibility of experiencing the soul. But I do think it wise to rent any\nfilm first, including this one, to see if you like it enough to buy it.\nIf you can\\'t find it at your video store, Netflix has it. If you\\'re\nnot a Netflix member, you can get a free trial for a couple of weeks and\nmake this one of your selections. Then if you do like it, I think it\nwould be worthy addition to your spiritual film libray.\n\n3\\. I was like the previous reviewer. I had rented it and after watching\nit the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental! I\nloved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies\nbeyond our human experience. How lovely to know that there is a life we\ncan barely imagine, waiting to be returned to. And I didn\\'t learn this\nfact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years\nand already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this\nbrief stay on Earth.\n\nThis video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a\nglimpse into that wonderful place that is our true Home. People who are\ndying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come. My own\nMother saw her Mother as she died. She came to take her Home. There is\nno specific religion addressed here, only the fact that there is more to\nlife than living and dying. And that it is something to be totally\nunafraid of. In fact physical death is only the beginning of something\ngreat; it is a step in the evolution of our souls.\n\n	2011-10-08	2011-08-06 03:42:28.756746	2011-11-11 03:02:16.699105	<p>Two Fabulous Full-length Feature Films.

155	Guest Speaker: Bill Guggenheim	Co-Author of **Hello From Heaven!**, Co-Founder of field of After-Death Communication (ADC); now communicates with his deceased daughter, Grandpa went down on Titanic	Bill Guggenheim and his former wife, Judy Guggenheim, conducted seven years of research on After-Death Communication (ADC) for their best-selling book, **Hello From Heaven!**\r\n\r\nDuring this time they interviewed 2,000 people and collected more than 3,300 firsthand accounts of ADC experiences.  Bill is on the Board of Advisers of the International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS), and is a member of the Association for Death Education and Counseling (ADEC).\r\n\r\nHe presents workshops at conferences for bereavement support groups, hospices, churches, colleges, and many other types of institutions.  His ADC research and book have been featured on television (including “20/20″) and radio (including “Coast To Coast AM” twice), and in numerous newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nAn After-Death Communication (ADC) is a spiritual experience that occurs when someone is contacted directly and spontaneously by a deceased family member or friend.  These are direct contacts because no psychics, mediums, or devices are involved.  They are spontaneous experiences because our deceased loved ones choose when, where, and how to contact us.\r\n\r\n**Hello From Heaven!** founded the field of after-death communication research. Bill will discuss the twelve major types of ADC experiences that people most frequently report.  He will also describe six categories of ADCs that prove they are objective experiences, and that they provide convincing modern day evidence for life after death.

160	Guest Speaker:   Rev. Anne Puryear	Author of "Stephen Lives! My Son Stephen, His Life, Suicide and Afterlife","Messages from God" and "1-800-Heaven"	Anne Puryear, D.D., is an author, minister, therapist and Vice-President and Co-founder of The Logos Center in Scottsdale, Arizona. She and her husband, Herb Puryear, Ph.D., incorporated Logos on May 26, 1983 in the State of Arizona. Anne’s psychic work has earned her international recognition as one of the most helpful, hopeful, motivating and life-changing spiritual counselors in the country.\r\n\r\nAnne has talked to God since she was a child, but she has also listened to God speak to her. As an adult she began to write down their conversations and wrote a book about their talks, MESSAGES FROM GOD. She can often see angels and commune with them, and has daily conversations with her spirit plane guides and helpers. Her spiritual journey of psychic work and amazing experiences began in 1972. She was in a grocery store, picked up Ruth Montgomery’s book, SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH, and a loud male voice behind her said, "Read this book!" She turned around and no one was there. Within days after reading the book, she had a series of illuminating experiences, including two open vision encounters with Jesus. Since then she has been able to use her intuition and clairvoyance abilities in profoundly helpful and healing ways, and to develop her strong empathic abilities.\r\n\r\nAlthough she is currently not giving readings because of several books she is researching and writing, her life readings have been a source of help and hope for thousands of people for more than 25 years. They are given at a distance or in person. Her work in an altered state of consciousness is very much like that of Edgar Cayce. (Interestingly, they were both born in Kentucky - Anne in Danville, Cayce in Hopkinsville.) Anne’s ability to see auras, discern energy blockages about the body and to suggest ways of correcting these energy patters brings an extraordinary helpful dimension to her counseling and diagnostic work.\r\n\r\nHer readings give special emphasis on the soul purpose, soul lessons, and the reasons for incarnating and past life experiences, which are strongly related to the present incarnation. She has been especially helpful in encouraging people to discover and activate their soul purpose, and to bring greater joy into their lives. She also gives physical, health and life guidance readings. Her readings were part of an on-going research project for 20 years, with extraordinary feedback as to accuracy and helpfulness.\r\n\r\nAnne was Co-founder of the Spiritual Science Research Center in Washington, D.C., and after moving to Phoenix in 1977, spent four years as Director of the Department of Spiritual Healing at the A.R.E. Medical Clinic, the Medical Research Division of the Edgar Cayce Foundation. There she taught classes, lectured, and gave life readings for patients in special medical programs. Trained in Gestalt and other therapies, she often counsels with suicidal children and adults, and survivors of suicide. Before that she was the Co-founder of the Center for Life Guidance in Phoenix.\r\n\r\nShe wrote a newspaper column for five years and her articles have appeared in numerous publications. Her psychic work and research with children has appeared in national publications, books, videos, TV and movies. She has worked with doctors, educators and health care professionals around the world and has appeared frequently on radio and television.\r\n\r\nAnne is deeply committed to bringing to the world a greater understanding of teenage suicide and life after death. After the death of her son Stephen in 1974, she began a search to understand his suicide. She has become an expert on the subject through her studies of both the scientific and esoteric research on suicide and life after death.\r\n\r\nHer book, STEPHEN LIVES! My Son Stephen, His Life, Suicide and Afterlife, about his death and communications with her from the other side, has received outstanding reviews from both professional and lay readers. First published by New Paradigm Press, it was later bought and published by Simon & Schuster in New York, first in hardcover, then in paperback, then in audio form read by the author. She was sent on a national book tour when the book was printed, appeared on talk shows in New York and major cities, radio shows, and interviewed by newspapers across country. Two television crews, one from Hard Copy, the other from Sightings, flew to Phoenix to interview her not only about her book but about the research she and Herb were doing in The Threshold Room on life after death. These interviews and several others still appear as repeats on primetime TV.\r\n\r\nAnne still communes with her son Stephen, and plans to write a sequel to STEPHEN LIVES! after finishing several other books she is writing. She continues to communicate with her Spirit Plane guides and friends who have made the transition over the years.\r\n\r\nThe Threshold Project is a work she is passionate about, and three research projects have been completed with 20-25 participants in each, to communicate with loved ones or friends who have died. The results are promising and sometimes astounding, and Anne & Herb plan a book on this research to help others learn how to more effectively attune to those who have died.\r\n\r\nAnne is the mother of four grown children (including Stephen who died) and grandmother to a "bunch" of growing, thriving young souls. Anne is a certified Scuba diver, an avid reader, walks, hikes and canoes with Herb, loves art and paints and draws in her "spare time". The Puryears are also animal lovers and consider their two male toy poodles, Beethoven and Happy, family members. Anne and Herb will celebrate their Silver Anniversary – 25 years – on Christmas Day 2007. Married in a Greek Orthodox Monastery in Phoenix right after midnight Christmas 1982, with 70 of their friends in attendance, they have had an amazing adventure together.\r\n\r\nAnne and Herb have led over 15 world tours to Egypt, Israel, China, Tibet, Greece, Turkey, Yucatan, Peru, Hawaii, Italy and throughout Europe, and lectured and presented workshops worldwide in other countries also. They co-hosted TV shows The Psychic and the Psychologist, and Mysteries of the Mind which ran for five years, with guest speakers in the field of parapsychology.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding feature of their work are twenty four 90 minute CDs, entitled THE MILLENNIUM READINGS: A Series of Psychic Answers to Life’s Most Often Asked Questions. Included with the 24 CDs is a free copy of a 90 minute CD on World Affairs recorded in 2010. The Series is available through the Logos online bookstore.\r\n\r\nA quote from a newspaper article interview of the Puryears says in part, "They are an extraordinary team, working together in a field that is fast becoming a way of the future. Herbert Bruce Puryear, Ph.D., and his wife Anne, strongly believe that if mankind is to be helped, now and in the difficult times that may lie ahead, we must be attuning at all three levels of being - body, mind and spirit. Toward this end, they have established a center, which will include psychic research, comparative religion (with church services or Sunday morning celebrations) and holistic healing. They would also like to see different organizations (and faiths) working together, using benefits and strengths of each to help each other. It would be difficult to find two better-qualified individuals to carry out such a concept."	2012-10-13	2011-08-06 03:42:29.046683	2012-10-23 05:47:15.257765	<p>Anne Puryear, D.D., is an author, minister, therapist and Vice-President and Co-founder of The Logos Center in Scottsdale, Arizona.

She has worked with doctors, educators and health care professionals around the world and has appeared frequently on radio and television.</p>\n\n<p>Anne is deeply committed to bringing to the world a greater understanding of teenage suicide and life after death. After the death of her son Stephen in 1974, she began a search to understand his suicide. She has become an expert on the subject through her studies of both the scientific and esoteric research on suicide and life after death.</p>\n\n<p>Her book, STEPHEN LIVES! My Son Stephen, His Life, Suicide and Afterlife, about his death and communications with her from the other side, has received outstanding reviews from both professional and lay readers. First published by New Paradigm Press, it was later bought and published by Simon &amp; Schuster in New York, first in hardcover, then in paperback, then in audio form read by the author. She was sent on a national book tour when the book was printed, appeared on talk shows in New York and major cities, radio shows, and interviewed by newspapers across country. Two television crews, one from Hard Copy, the other from Sightings, flew to Phoenix to interview her not only about her book but about the research she and Herb were doing in The Threshold Room on life after death. These interviews and several others still appear as repeats on primetime TV.</p>\n\n<p>Anne still communes with her son Stephen, and plans to write a sequel to STEPHEN LIVES! after finishing several other books she is writing. She continues to communicate with her Spirit Plane guides and friends who have made the transition over the years.</p>\n\n<p>The Threshold Project is a work she is passionate about, and three research projects have been completed with 20-25 participants in each, to communicate with loved ones or friends who have died. The results are promising and sometimes astounding, and Anne &amp; Herb plan a book on this research to help others learn how to more effectively attune to those who have died.</p>\n\n<p>Anne is the mother of four grown children (including Stephen who died) and grandmother to a &ldquo;bunch&rdquo; of growing, thriving young souls. Anne is a certified Scuba diver, an avid reader, walks, hikes and canoes with Herb, loves art and paints and draws in her &ldquo;spare time&rdquo;. The Puryears are also animal lovers and consider their two male toy poodles, Beethoven and Happy, family members. Anne and Herb will celebrate their Silver Anniversary – 25 years – on Christmas Day 2007. Married in a Greek Orthodox Monastery in Phoenix right after midnight Christmas 1982, with 70 of their friends in attendance, they have had an amazing adventure together.</p>\n\n<p>Anne and Herb have led over 15 world tours to Egypt, Israel, China, Tibet, Greece, Turkey, Yucatan, Peru, Hawaii, Italy and throughout Europe, and lectured and presented workshops worldwide in other countries also. They co-hosted TV shows The Psychic and the Psychologist, and Mysteries of the Mind which ran for five years, with guest speakers in the field of parapsychology.</p>\n\n<p>An outstanding feature of their work are twenty four 90 minute CDs, entitled THE MILLENNIUM READINGS: A Series of Psychic Answers to Life’s Most Often Asked Questions. Included with the 24 CDs is a free copy of a 90 minute CD on World Affairs recorded in 2010. The Series is available through the Logos online bookstore.</p>\n\n<p>A quote from a newspaper article interview of the Puryears says in part, &ldquo;They are an extraordinary team, working together in a field that is fast becoming a way of the future. Herbert Bruce Puryear, Ph.D., and his wife Anne, strongly believe that if mankind is to be helped, now and in the difficult times that may lie ahead, we must be attuning at all three levels of being - body, mind and spirit. Toward this end, they have established a center, which will include psychic research, comparative religion (with church services or Sunday morning celebrations) and holistic healing. They would also like to see different organizations (and faiths) working together, using benefits and strengths of each to help each other. It would be difficult to find two better-qualified individuals to carry out such a concept.&rdquo;</p>\n	t

162	Guest Speaker:  RaNelle Wallace	NDEr; Author of "The Burning Within", Died in a fiery plane crash and survived, met her yet unborn son on the other side....	 On October 9, 1985, RaNelle and Terry Wallace tried to fly their single-engine airplane through a snowstorm in central Utah. They became disoriented and crashed against the side of a mountain, turning their small craft into a raging inferno. Terry emerged almost unscathed, but RaNelle suffered severe burns and died six hours later in an ambulance. What happened to her then has captured the hearts of thousands who have heard of her incredible journey beyond this life.  While in heaven, she met her son who was not yet born into the world. This aspect of her experience makes her near-death very unique.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBut this is more than a near-death story. RaNelle's tenacity and courage in overcoming her burns propelled her into a life of success and service. Within two years she had served as a counselor for hundreds of other burn victims, established various educational and support groups, received many awards and citations, and was named California Woman of the Year. But of more import to RaNelle, she had found herself.   The searing torture she felt while being burned alive was only a prelude to the pain she experienced battling, and finally overcoming, her inner fears.\r\n\r\nAfter recovering from devastating injuries suffered in the plane accident, RaNelle Wallace turned outward to community service and fulfillment.  As a recipient of numerous commendations, including special recognition from President Ronald Reagan, RaNelle has taken her message of love and endurance to the public as a professional speaker. She has also appeared on television and major magazines and newspapers across the country. RaNelle's service also extends to Girl Scouts, numerous church groups, community boards, and to hundreds of burn victims who have benefitted from her counsel and compassion. She is currently working as co-producer of a new CNBC show. 	2012-12-08	2011-08-06 03:42:29.067978	2013-01-13 07:08:37.223258	<p>On October 9, 1985, RaNelle and Terry Wallace tried to fly their single-engine airplane through a snowstorm in central Utah.

Dr. Stone has received an American Board of Hypnotherapy\n\\"Special Recognition Award\\" three times for his hypnotherapy\ncontributions.\n\nAs the host of Inner Quest, a Chicago-area cable television show, he and\nhis guests discuss ancient and modern healing arts and the many paths\nleading to self-discovery. Dr. Stone has interviewed Daniel Amen, Joan\nBorysenko, Ram Dass, Larry Dossey, Judith Orloff, Bernie Siegel and\nother best-selling authors.\n\nJay Stone\\'s first patient was himself! In his very first self-hypnosis\nsession in 1982, he ended his twenty-year nail-biting habit. He next\napplied hypnosis to his own weight problem. Since 1983 he has not gained\nback any of the fifty pounds he lost thanks to hypnosis. Dr. Stone has\nnot missed a day of self-hypnosis since that successful first experience\nin 1982. Pursuing his life\\'s work and utilizing his own unique skills\nsince that time, he has helped people in all walks of life achieve their\nphysical, emotional and financial goals.\n\n Because of Stone\\'s knowledge of hypnosis and past life regression, Hidden Treasures Production and Koch Vision featured him in a documentary film which was released in March, 2007. His book,<i> Sacred Cycles</i>, explains how mental, emotional and spiritual development are both a process and product of cycles and how the brain, body and mind experience multiple trances each day.

134	Near-Death Movies	Two Fabulous Full-length Feature Films.  Bring your popcorn...no intermission.  First movie begins promptly at 2 pm.	Welcome to a wonderful afternoon of mystical fun! Both of these movies\nare entertaining and informative...\n\nA NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE (2008)\n\nA very well done near-death experience brings to life a woman who comes\nback with the ability to see ghosts after her NDE.\n\nAmy Acker is the top talent in this LMN flick, with Johanna Nutter and\nJames A. Woods (among others) ably embodying the supporting characters.\nAcker is Ellie, a woman who has the \\"near death experience\\" from the\nget-go. After awakening in the hospital, she soon realizes she brought\nsomething back with her from her brush with death...something that\nfrightens her and simultaneously lends her power to get people\nheard...dead people, that is.\n\nWHAT ON EARTH? (2009)...winner “Best Feature Documentary” at the 2009\nUFO Congress Film Festival\n\nIntricate designs in crops turn up in farmers’ fields overnight.\nAlthough they have appeared throughout the world for many years, no one\nknows where they come from or why they arrive.\n\nFor fifteen years, Suzanne Taylor has been part of a lively community of\nvisionary artists, scientist, philosophers, geometers and farmers who\nare drawn to England by the circles every summer.\n\nThis 81-minute feature documentary tracks her interactions with these\n“croppies” as they go circle-chasing, indulge in circle-analysis, and\nshare why they are so fascinated by the phenomenon.\n\nIt also deals with how our scientific materialistic worldview hampers\nserious investigation of a great mystery of our time, and how knowing\nthe circles come from another intelligence would help us think as a\nplanet to solve the problems that challenge us now...\n\n<i> “At all costs, don’t miss What on Earth? It deals intelligently with\nthe globe’s most persistent and beautiful mystery, the crop circles.

149	Guest Speaker:  Kelly Standing	3 NDEs; Humorous Motivational Speaker, Author	Hit by a car. Struck by lightning.  Hanged from a tree. Survived a mass murder. At age 29, went into the “White Light” and lived to tell. What does Kelly Standing do when she’s NOT dodging death and natural disasters?  \r\n \r\nBorn and raised in St. Louis, a product of the University Of Missouri School Of Journalism … Kelly started her career in public relations and quickly chose to specialize in speechwriting and corporate script writing.  She LOVED getting paid to put words into other people’s mouths.\r\n \r\nShe met fascinating people along the way, including business management guru Peter Drucker. She met a U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, appeared on World News Tonight with Peter Jennings and met Oscar winner Roberto Bengini. She met the Today Show’s Willard Scott, celebrity doctors, professional football players and countless captains of industry. One speech led to another. Her practice grew and, for more than 15 years, she served as speechwriter and coach to some of America's top executives in a broad range of industries.\r\n \r\nThrough her professional lens she saw organizations  sink or soar based on the attitudes their people had toward change, adversity and uncertainty. Based on all her brushes with death on the personal side, she developed an uncommonly positive, even fearless, approach to those topics. Kelly welcomes change. She weathers adversity remarkably well. She’s still STANDING.\r\n \r\nEarly on, her parents taught her to see the world as it could be, not as it is … to see the possibility in her pain. Now, Kelly shares her dad’s secret recipe for resilience with audiences all over the United States. She believes anyone can apply his formula … on Main Street, Wall Street or Sesame Street.\r\n \r\nWhen Kelly’s speechwriting clients heard everything she had to say on the professional side, they invited her to tell her personal story – all the “near-death stuff.” Apparently, they liked her philosophy and approach and trusted her to be passionate without getting preachy.  Smart companies know they have to feed the part of their employees that’s starving. Kelly fed them. Kelly’s speaking career took her all the way to the World Championship of Public Speaking in 2001. She ranked in the top nine speakers in the world out of 25,000 competitors and 180,000 Toastmasters.\r\n \r\nIn 2003, based on all her brushes with death, she wondered if she might be called to ministry or hospice chaplaincy. She explored the possibilities in seminary. As part of her coursework, she served as a chaplain to criminal youth for a year in St. Louis, served a church for a year in older adult and general ministry and served as a student chaplain at a Level One trauma center in Chicago for a year, helping patients and families as they approached death. Ultimately, she felt called back to her career as speaker and coach, but with life-altering new insights and experiences.\r\n \r\nToday, Kelly amuses, entertains, encourages and inspires audience members to find in themselves the resilience and ability to adapt that she learned the hard way. She went from speechwriter to speaker to author with her memoir, I'M STILL STANDING: How One Woman's Brushes with Death Taught Her How To Live.\r\n \r\nKelly stepped in at the last minute to substitute for Jane Katra, who cancelled a few hours before her presentation. It was the first time Kelly had attended a meeting of Chicago IANDS.  Everyone loved her and she received a standing ovation.\r\n \r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJane Katra holds a Ph.D. in Public Health from the University of Oregon,\r\nwhere she taught mind-body health classes in the 1980’s. Dr. Katra has\r\nalso practiced as a natural spiritual healer for thirty-four years.\r\nKatra is the coauthor with physicist Russell Targ of the books *Miracles\r\nof Mind: Exploring Nonlocal Consciousness* and *Spiritual\r\nHealing(1998),* and *The Heart of the Mind (1999)*. Her work has been\r\nfeatured in the book *Reinventing Medicine* by Larry Dossey, and in\r\nScience of Mind, Natural Health, Alternative Therapies, New Dimensions,\r\nSpirituality and Health, and Noetic Sciences Review.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, Dr. Jane Katra received instructions about being a\r\nspiritual healer during a near-death experience, and in 2003 she began\r\nreceiving communications from her recently deceased step-daughter. These\r\nexperiences have launched her on a quest to understand mind-to-mind\r\ncommunications, which involve not only knowing who has telephoned you,\r\nbut also the possibility of being attuned to and transformed by a\r\ngreater transpersonal field of Infinite Mind.\r\n\r\nDr. Katra transmits an evolutionary experience of naturally radiating\r\nenergy, and teaches classes in Esoteric Wisdom, Psychic & Spiritual\r\nDevelopment, Remote Viewing, Forgiveness as Transformation, Facing Death\r\n& Meeting Soul, Awakened Activism; Patanjali, Ramana Maharshi & Becoming\r\nWho We Are. Dr. Katra is active in healing research, is featured as part\r\nof The Science & Consciousness Visionary DVD Club, and has presented at\r\nOmega, Esalen, The Institute of Noetic Sciences, The Monroe Institute,\r\nThe International Conference on Science & Consciousness, the Rhine\r\nResearch Center where she is on the advisory board, and to medical\r\nschools and spiritual organizations internationally.\r\n\r\n *Developing Healing Power: Awakening Subtle Perception & Higher Vibration and Receive Spiritual, Emotional & Physical Healing....

153	Dr. Eben Alexander  III, MD	NDEr, Neurosurgeon, Author, has an amazing Near-Death Experience	Eben Alexander III MD has been an academic neurosurgeon for the last 25\r\nyears, including 15 years at Harvard Medical School.

For\r\nreasons still obscure, he was overcome by bacterial meningitis, rendered\r\ncomatose on a ventilator in the ICU within hours.

150	Guest Speaker:   Joe Wolfe	NDEr, 10 years in prison, author, acclaimed ACIM teacher	*from Joe Wolfe:*\r\n\r\n It was 1974 and I was twenty-four years of age at the time. My own history up to that point was one like so many stories of a young street thug, growing up in a working class Chicago neighborhood, discouraged and disillusioned by the mediocrity and grind of what life had to offer. That there had to be something better was always a predominating\r\nthought. So \\'better\\' for me, was the excitement and the radical\r\ncamaraderie of our little clique of thugs, always plotting, always\r\nstealing, always looking for that thrill. So when those activities\r\nresulted in my first arrests, confinement in juvenile punishment\r\nfacilities and finally in a ten year prison sentence,( the big time), I\r\nwas brought to a juncture. I would crash and burn. Previously embraced\r\njustifications for my anti-social behavior would soon be shattered and\r\nall of the glamour of the life of a criminal would cease to contain even\r\na trace of validity. The underlying conviction that there had to be\r\nsomething better still remained but now (after the experience I\\'ll\r\ndescribe below) that something would take on an entirely new and\r\nremarkable definition.\r\n\r\nSo at twenty-four and while wallowing in the misery of prison life this\r\nis what occurred that would lead to forever changing the way I would\r\nperceive the world:\r\n\r\nThe real Me...The I...The Essence of Who and Where I AM emerged for just\r\na few short minutes one summer afternoon after an entire sleepless night\r\nof worry and immense fear over the possibility that I might be killed\r\nthe following day. For the first time in many years I turned to the God\r\nI perceived and I prayed for deliverance. I begged and prayed for many\r\nhours with fever and intensity never before offered. \\'He\\'\r\nanswered...\\'He\\' delivered me. And for a few brief moments \\'He\\'\r\nlifted Me from the body and embraced Me as a loving Father does His Son\r\nand assured Me once again, that I would be all right.\r\n\r\nWhile the body lay on the prison cell cot below, the awareness of \\"I\\"\r\nexpanded to include every molecule of air around Me... every feature,\r\nthe sunlight that streamed through the barred window, the trees and\r\ngrass outside, the room itself...everything was Me. A crescendo of\r\n\\'sound\\' accompanied the experience that completely absorbed all sound\r\non earth and played as every instrument in every orchestra all over the\r\nworld, in perfect harmony. This experience launched my search for the\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\nNow, many years later, and after much search, many books, and after the\r\nmessage of Forgiveness as gently prescribed in A Course in Miracles, I\r\ncame to realize that the \\'person\\' who searched would never find the\r\nanswers. That person, a product of the same thought system that created\r\nhim, would seek and never find because he was simply in the way. His\r\nbeliefs, his concepts and ascribed personage blocked the very awareness\r\nof that which he sought. He had to get out of his own way first. He had\r\nto surrender his own image of who he thought he was before any Real\r\nknowledge could enter. The little self had to be first seen for what it\r\nreally was, then sacrificed (for lack of a better word) to make room for\r\nsomething much bigger.\r\n\r\nThe Law of Forgiveness would lend him the means to do just that. In\r\nForgiveness, the little self would fade into the oblivion from which it\r\ncame and what would emerge is what was there all along. That Essence of\r\nthe Real Self, that \\"I\\" and that assurance that everything would be\r\nalright. And from that Essence a Power uncommon in this perceived world\r\nwould accompany it and everything would change for the better, forever.\r\n\r\nToday, almost every day this writer visits the local post office to\r\ndeliver copies of the original edition of A Course in Miracles \\[donated\r\nby Course in Miracles Society\\] along with an easy to comprehend\r\nintroduction to The Course as made available through the text version of\r\nGary R. Renard’s The End of Reincarnation to lists of prisoners who have\r\nexpressed the desire to learn more about the Course. With the text\r\nversion is a brief essay describing what is referred to as The Five\r\nSigns, five mystical experiences during this life which began at the age\r\nof three and culminated with the experience described above. This\r\nexperience led to adopting a practical application of the spiritual\r\ndiscipline taught in A Course in Miracles.\r\n\r\nWith the help of people like Jon Mundy and his Miracles Magazine, Regina\r\nDawn Akers and her The Holy Spirit’s Interpretation of the New\r\nTestament, Gary R. Renard and Tami Simon, (The End of Reincarnation) and\r\nDov Fishman of The One Mind Foundation and Acim Gather, as well as\r\nBeverly Hutchenson, Marrianne Williamson, Robert Perry, and those\r\nfriends who assist with postage donations, and especially Course In\r\nMiracles Society, a new wave of compassion is spreading throughout the\r\npopulations of prisons all over the country.\r\n\r\nFor many of these prisoners, long forgotten by family or friends, this\r\nnew avenue of communication brings welcome relief and a gentle, warm and\r\nloving response to their cry for help. It brings Hope where apathy,\r\ndespair and grief make their home. It delivers Love where blame, guilt\r\nand punishment saturate the atmosphere. It brings the possibility of the\r\nPeace of God to a ‘place’ where the egos appetite for misery, pain and\r\nhopelessness can now move aside to welcome a glimmer of Light.\r\n\r\nMay the Love, Light and Peace of God be experienced by them, and with\r\nevery second feel another moment spent in His Endless Embrace.\r\n\r\nJoe Wolfe, Spirit Light Outreach\r\n\r\nFor more information, please go to: [\r\n*http://www.spiritlightoutreach.org/*][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.spiritlightoutreach.org/ \r\n	2011-12-10	2011-08-06 03:42:28.808375	2012-01-11 05:48:14.317978	<p><em>from Joe Wolfe:</em></p>\n\n<p>It was 1974 and I was twenty-four years of age at the time.

194	Guest Speaker:   Rich Martini	Chicago native, Author, Filmmaker, Award-winning American film director, producer, screenwriter and free lance journalist. 	After Rich Martini had several “Other” experiences, including the death of a soul mate, which revealed to him that there is more to life than is apparent, he started exploring and looking for more information and answers to the truth about life and death.\r\n\r\n*Flipside* was his debut non-fiction book.  The film documentary is distributed by Gaiam TV and Amazon Prime.  After experiencing a dream visit with his friend on the other side, Martini went on a literary quest to find out how science and philosophy are currently explaining these phenomena.\r\n\r\nHe journeyed into Tibetan Philosophy, made documentaries in Tibet and India, and eventually was introduced to the work of the Newton Institute, founded by renowned author and hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton (Author of *Journey of Souls*). The book contains interviews with numerous hypnotherapists who talk about past life regression and life-between-life therapy, using the information to help patients examine their immortal identity. \r\n\r\n*Flipside* went to #1 at Amazon (Kindle, all its genres) and Rich’s follow up series *It’s a Wonderful Afterlife* also went to #1 due to his appearances on “Coast to Coast” radio.   *It’s a Wonderful Afterlife* expands his research into the afterlife, including interviews with Bruce Greyson,MD, Mario Beauregard, PhD, and Gary Schwartz, PhD, about consciousness existing outside the brain.  The author interviews people who’ve had both near-death experiences and between-life hypnotherapy sessions and includes transcripts from between-life sessions….including his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1978, Rich graduated Magna Cum Laude from Boston University with a BA degree in Humanitiess.  He attended USC Film School and received an MA degree in 2008 from their Master of Professional Writing Program.   He also took improv classes at Second City in Chicago under Jo Forsberg and with the Harvey Lembeck Workshop in LA.\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n\r\n*Richard has written a terrific book.

The film documentary is distributed by Gaiam TV and Amazon Prime.  After experiencing a dream visit with his friend on the other side, Martini went on a literary quest to find out how science and philosophy are currently explaining these phenomena.</p>\n\n<p>He journeyed into Tibetan Philosophy, made documentaries in Tibet and India, and eventually was introduced to the work of the Newton Institute, founded by renowned author and hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton (Author of <em>Journey of Souls</em>). The book contains interviews with numerous hypnotherapists who talk about past life regression and life-between-life therapy, using the information to help patients examine their immortal identity. </p>\n\n<p><em>Flipside</em> went to #1 at Amazon (Kindle, all its genres) and Rich’s follow up series <em>It’s a Wonderful Afterlife</em> also went to #1 due to his appearances on “Coast to Coast” radio.   <em>It’s a Wonderful Afterlife</em> expands his research into the afterlife, including interviews with Bruce Greyson,MD, Mario Beauregard, PhD, and Gary Schwartz, PhD, about consciousness existing outside the brain.  The author interviews people who’ve had both near-death experiences and between-life hypnotherapy sessions and includes transcripts from between-life sessions….including his own.</p>\n\n<p>In 1978, Rich graduated Magna Cum Laude from Boston University with a BA degree in Humanitiess.  He attended USC Film School and received an MA degree in 2008 from their Master of Professional Writing Program.   He also took improv classes at Second City in Chicago under Jo Forsberg and with the Harvey Lembeck Workshop in LA.</p>\n\n<p>Reviews:</p>\n\n<p><em>Richard has written a terrific book.

He had a fine home, a family, and, for 20\nyears, a successful career as an artist and art professor at Northern\nKentucky University. Like many of his colleagues in the academic\ncommunity, he was an atheist, believing that \\"When you die, you die,\nand that\\'s it.\\"\n\nIn June, 1985, he took a group of his art students to Paris. Without\nwarning, he found himself in the hospital in excruciating pain, awaiting\nan emergency operation and he realized with horror that his death was a\nreal possibility.\n\nStorm was totally unprepared for what was to happen next. He found\nhimself out of his body, staring at his own physical form. But this was\nno hallucination; he was fully aware and felt more alive than ever\nbefore. In his spirit form, Storm was drawn into fearsome realms of\ndarkness and death, where he experienced the terrible consequences of a\nlife of selfishness and materialism. However, his journey also took him\ninto regions of light where he conversed with angelic beings and the\nLord of Light Himself, who sent him back to earth with a message of\nlove.\n\nFollowing his near-death experience, his life was transformed. He\neventually studied to become a pastor and in 1992 was ordained in the\nUnited Church of Christ. He now is pastor at Zion United Church of\nChrist in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The art of many regions of the\nAmazon basin has been influenced by visions induced through a journey\nwith Grandmother Ayahuasca.\n</p> <p>\nRichard Sandore is a Western-trained physician who practiced obstetrics\nand gynecology for nine years.  During that time he began working with\nnative healers in South America.  Their encompassing worldview and\nconcepts of healing changed his life.  Dr. Sandore is a recognized\nexpert in the field of complementary healing, and until recently had a\nhealing practice north of Chicago.  He is now based in California and\nlectures, teaches, and leads groups to work with spiritual healers in\nSouth America, and has been the featured speaker at numerous\nconferences, including the Whole Life Expo and the National Wellness\nConference.  He also is a regular speaker at midwestern colleges,\nincluding Illinois Wesleyan University, and is the author of Living the\nSteps to Vibrancy and numerous other works.  Currently Dr Sandore spends\nthe majority of his time working with spiritual seekers who desire\nintensive, in-depth training.  He also is in the process of writing his\nfourth novel.\n</p> <p>For more information, please visit Dr. Sandore&#39;s web site:</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.richardsandore.com">\n<em><a href="http://www.richardsandore.com">www.richardsandore.com</a></em></a>\n </p> </tt></i></p>\n	t

95	Guest Speaker:  Shelley Yates	NDEr from Nova Scotia	Shelley Yates, 41, is an ordinary woman on an extraordinary journey. She\nlives in Nova Scotia, Canada, and has not only died and come back, but\nhad the wonderful good fortune to come back with a message of hope and\nlove for our earth and its inhabitants. Shelley first learned how to\napply her new knowledge from beyond to bring her son back from death in\nan unprecedented display, using the power of faith, love and the\nmanipulation of personal human energy. Her son returned whole and happy.\nShe was told \\"what you did for a dying boy with a small group of people\nyou can do for a dying planet with a large group.\\" She shares her story\nof miracles and her knowledge of human energy potential with all that\nare willing to listen. Her final outcome has been the creation of a\nworld project in which all of humanity can contribute to change the\nearth we live on, creating prosperity, peace and healing for all that\ndesire it.\n\nShelley Yates and her son, Evan, were drowned in 2002 when their car\nhydroplaned off the road, overturned, and sank to the bottom of a\nflooded marsh in Nova Scotia. Shelley was trapped in the car. A voice\ntold her not to struggle or she would not be able to be revived when she\nwould be rescued. She had never heard such a voice before this. She did\nnot believe in God. She says of herself, \\"I was a \\'diehard\natheist\\'.\\" Yet, she did not struggle, and she drowned. It was 15\nminutes before she was rescued.\n\nAfter she was revived, she alerted the EMT\\'s to find her son, who was\nage 4 at the time. Close to 30 minutes passed before he was pulled from\nthe water. It took more time for the EMT\\'s to get him breathing again.\n\nAt the hospital, he was diagnosed as brain dead with non-viable organs,\nand given only 1% chance of surviving. However, Shelley was told by the\nvoice that he would recover if many persons came and shared the energy\nof their auras for 20 minutes each. She was told that this would in\neffect \\"jump-start\\" Evan.\n\nSo Shelley scheduled people to come to the hospital around the clock for\nthree days. After 72 hours of constant vigil, Evan opened his eyes and\nrecognized his mother. His recovery proceeded rapidly after that. He was\nin excellent shape after only six weeks. He did have a short-term memory\nproblem, but now even that has been healed.\n\nThe voices also told Shelley that the earth needs the same help. We\nshare energy with the earth in a living loop. However, because so many\nof us have disconnected from Source, our energy is so low that we are\nnot returning energy to the earth. As a result the auric energy field of\nthe earth has been depleted and is disintegrating.\n\nShelley was told that we can \\"jump-start\\" the energy system of the\nearth if we combine the energy of our love and gratitude for one hour\nbeginning at 11:11 a. m. GMT on Wednesday, July 17, 2007 (That\\'s 6:11\na. m. to 7:11 a. m. Eastern Time.) We are invited to join in a\nworld-wide vigil for that hour, holding within our consciousness\nsomething that brings joy and for which we feel thankful. We are asked\nto extend gratitude to the earth because energy is sent out when we are\nin that state of mind. The resulting surge of energy will be a catalyst\nto enable the earth to sustain its own energy again.\n\nShelley was also told that those who participate will be able to\naccelerate the growth of their own field, and that this will lead them\ninto the next stage of the development of humankind, which will be lived\nat the higher frequency of love and gratitude.\n\nThe hour of recharging the energy of the earth\\'s field will be only the\nbeginning. Over time we can expect to see changes so that the earth\\'s\nresources will be shared to meet the needs of everyone, starting with\nthose on the African continent. The goal is to unite this world as one\nplanet - to establish peace and prosperity for all. This is not\nShelley\\'s plan. It was dictated to her by the voices that she still\nhears.\n\nThe word has been spreading. The message, plan, and invitation have been\ntranslated into ten languages with two more soon to receive it. Local\ncoordinators have been spreading the information in 200 countries. The\nplan is becoming common knowledge among youth.\n\n	2007-05-12	2011-08-06 03:42:27.386715	2011-11-11 03:02:19.389052	<p>Shelley Yates, 41, is an ordinary woman on an extraordinary journey.

120	Guest Speaker:  Jim Macartney, MA	NDEr from Seattle, Rehab Counselor, Author of new book, "Crisis to Creation"	Why do some of us stay stuck in crisis and others find ways to embrace\nnew opportunities---even entirely new ways of being in the world? What\nfactors work to transform post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) into\n“post-traumatic growth”?\n\nThese are two of the questions that rehabilitation counselor and NDE\nsurvivor Jim Macartney has long pondered. From his own personal and\nprofessional experience, he observed that the answers have something to\ndo with our consciously, and with full intention, CHOOSING to move past\nour stuckness, stepping past the edge of the known in order to open to\nhigher levels of life expressions. People growing through crisis exhibit\nmany of the same transformative changes as seen in typical NDE’s.\n\nAlthough Jim experienced an NDE in 1997 which he calls ”The single most\nprofound event of my life,” he urges his story be used as a parable to\nsymbolize what may lie outside our conditioned capacity to think and\nbelieve. Indeed it is within our power, Jim believes, to experience a\nmuch deeper level of our Being Human, turning what seems as irresolvable\ncrises into powerful gifts of new creation.\n\nCurrently Jim Macartney is synthesizing his research and writing a book\nwhich he hopes will help move individuals and our helping institutions\nfrom an orientation of fighting disability and limitation to one of\nfully engaging latent opportunity for growth.\n\nThose who’ve heard him address the NDE community, most recently at the\nIANDS 2008 conference in Durham, NC, Seattle and Salt Lake City, have\nreported a profoundly moving experience.\n\n	2009-06-13	2011-08-06 03:42:28.014335	2011-11-11 03:02:15.818508	<p>Why do some of us stay stuck in crisis and others find ways to embrace\nnew opportunities&mdash;even entirely new ways of being in the world?

Ellena Lynn Lieberman has been a dedicated teacher and consultant of the\nAkashic Records for almost twenty years. She follows the lineage of Mary\nDean Parker whom she considers her spiritual teacher. On the evening\nafter the first day of the class, Ellena was so inspired by the\nunprecedented amount of unconditional love and light from the Akashic\nRealms that she rushed home and declared to her husband: “This is for\nme!” Her heart awakening has led her to ever deepening development and\nexploration of what it means to attune to the level of the Akashic\nRecord of oneself and others.\n\nTo date, she and her physical sister, Roni Reisler, are the only\nteachers directly asked in 1991-1992 to begin teaching by Mary Parker.\nAfter intensive inner work and cultivating a life changing love of the\nAkashic Records, Mary simultaneously selected them because the two held\na balanced energy together, filled with love and support. They journeyed\nthrough many locales and worlds.

My\nsoul is overcome with gratitude, my heart with uncommon joy…Hope and\nPurpose are now imbued with the Holy Spirit.”…Chicago\n\n “Your insights into the Records were expressed beautifully and\neloquently. Thank you for your generous spirit and good work.”…New York\n\n “Many wonderful feelings are emerging since we spoke although they are\ndifficult to put into words right now-I am so grateful for your gifts.\nThank you from my whole heart.”…Louisiana\n\n “Ellena teaches and works with integrity and sensitivity. She is\nvigilant and steadfast in her approach, yet freely and creatively allows\nthe class to reach its natural energetic level ... When she sees\nfragmentation in the energy, she works to re-establish grounding and\nconnection to the higher vibrations”…Chicago\n\n “Thank you for your diligence and sensitivity in bringing forth what\nhas\nbeen “concealed.” This has given new meaning and momentum to my\nlife”…Chicago\n\n In her new book, *The Principles of Dynamic Manifestation as received\nthrough the Akashic Records*, she unites her knowledge of spirit, tone\nand “supernal” heart as she weaves the spiritual template of abundance\non all levels. “(The book)…does a fine job of examining the processes\nthat readers can apply to their own lives to raise their awareness and\ngrow spiritually, physically, emotionally, and financially, and gain new\ninsight and compassion through grace and God’s love&#8230. It presents a\ngreat deal of information...and the individual chapters transition\nseamlessly from one topic to the next&#8230. Your writing style\nsuccessfully serves to bring exceptional clarity to what is a complex\nsubject.” (Booksurge commentary)\n\n Simultaneously with her spiritual calling, Ellena has created and\nperforms a concert series “A Golden Treasury of Vintage Songs” in\nFlorida, Chicago, and New York.

131	Guest Speaker:  Peter Sterling	NDEr; Celtic harpist, Shaman, Peter Sterling brings the music of his heavenly experience to us.	Peter Sterling had a near-death experience which was self-induced. He\ntook more of a Shamanic route, using sacred substances in ritual and\nceremony to induce a transcendent deathlike state where he left his body\nand was taken up into the Light, and where he met the Angels and God\ndirectly! They told him he was to go back and to be a channel for the\nheavenly music which he was hearing and which permeated everything in a\nglorious sound of oneness and Divine Love. This is the source of his\nmusic.\n\nThere have been timeless musicians throughout history whose hands seem\nto be guided by unseen forces. Possessing unexplainable musical genius,\nthe exquisite beauty of their songs have delighted and mystified\naudiences the world over, somehow connecting us closer to heaven.\n\nPeter Sterling is one such musical treasure. A harpist of world-class\nskill, Peter\\'s eclectic music continues to touch the lives of thousands\naround the world. Devoted listeners over the years have consistently\nreported greater peace, spiritual visions, and even miraculous healings\nwhile listening to Peter\\'s heavenly albums, suggesting the astonishing\npotential of his uncanny musical gifts.\n\nA precious few can claim the musical foundations that led Peter to play\nthe harp. His unusual and inspiring story truly began during a series of\nlife-altering divine encounters while living outdoors in the peaceful\nsolitude of Sedona, Arizona\\'s Red Rock canyons. Spending countless\nhours at its sacred vortex sites practicing yoga and meditation amidst\nthe brilliant scenery and vast silence, Peter one day experienced a\ngenuine spiritual vision of angelic beings in a heavenly choir\nsurrounding him. In this profound vision, Peter saw himself strumming a\nharp and allowing divine music to flow through him. Although Peter\nshowed considerable musical talent as a child, having played the piano\nby ear and then dabbling with the flute and guitar over the years, music\nhad not been a prevalent part of his life. Overwhelmed by the grandeur\nof this angelic experience, Peter waited for the next series of\nsynchronicities to guide his choices.\n\nOnly a week later, Peter happened to meet an accomplished harpist who\nwas selling a Celtic harp. Quickly acquiring the instrument and\nreceiving one brief music lesson, Peter retreated back to the canyons\nwhere he humbly beseeched the heavens atop a red rock peak to allow the\nmusic of the harp to flow through him. Almost immediately his prayers\nwere answered as he began to instinctively strum chords and simple\nmelodies. \\"It was as if my hands knew what to do,\\" Peter said. It\nwasn\\'t long before the beginning melodies matured into distinct songs,\nclosely resembling the heavenly tones he once heard among the silence of\nthe canyons.\n\nIncredibly, Peter recorded his first album, Harp Magic, after a mere ten\nmonths with the harp, demonstrating a skill-level most experts would\nconsider impossible after such a brief time. Nevertheless, this is the\n\\"magic\\" of Peter\\'s remarkable story. Harp Magic went on to be\nnominated for the \\"Naird Indie Award\\" for best string album of 1994--a\nnational honor.\n\nIn 2004, Peter\\'s cd \\"Harp Dream\\'s\\" went to #1 on the N.A.R. top 100\nradio playlist for 8 weeks making it the most played new age music cd in\nthe United States, Canada and Europe. And was then nominated for \\"Album\nof the Year\\" by the same organization! As a result Peter signed with\nthe prestigious record label \\"Real Music\\" for the world wide release\nof his CD \\"Shadow,Mist and Light\\". His earlier celestial sounds have\nevolved into a contemporary instrumental mix of world fusion, with an\nimpressive advancement in his melodies complexity, groove, and\ninspirational quality, sounding at once seductive, hip, and angelic.\n\nPeter\\'s music continues to broaden in its appeal. Offering flavors of\njazz, classical, world music, and New Age styles, Peter\\'s music can be\nas rhythmic as it is healing. Peter tours extensively, performing his\nunique style of harp music to appreciative audiences the world over.\n\nFor more information, please go to: [ *http://www.harpmagic.com/*][1].\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.harpmagic.com/ \n	2010-05-08	2011-08-06 03:42:28.296402	2011-11-11 03:02:19.764245	<p>Peter Sterling had a near-death experience which was self-induced.

135	Guest Speaker:  Roni Reisler	Akashic Records Reader and Teacher;  Mandala Artist and Teacher	The Artist Roni Reisler has studied fiber and textile arts at the Art\ninstitute of Chicago and-painting with art critic Franz Schulz at Lake\nForest College. She worked as a fabric and accessories designer for\nSansappelle in Chicago and has maintained her own business studio,\nMagnificent Monkey, constructing bridal headpieces, beadwork, jewelry,\nand interior wall hangings.\n\nIn 1990 Roni, with her sister, had the good fortune to attend a workshop\non accessing the Akashic Records taught by Mary Parker. This particular\nmeditation technique centers on using a simple Holy Prayer which is the\nkey to allow information to come through while the reader is still\npresent and conscious. To Roni, it meant that it is possible to\nconsciously and deliberately tap into Divine Source while working on\ncreative projects.\n\nThis new information changed her life. Roni\\'s sister, Ellena Lieberman,\nwas spiritually called to teach the Akashic Records method to others and\nRoni chose to dedicate herself as her sister\\'s facilitator. Together,\nthey have traveled in North and South America conducting workshops. The\ntechnique has served them both as an exquisite tool to heighten and\ndeepen each of their Spiritual Paths.\n\nWhen she discovered Dr. Judith Cornell\\'s book, Mandala, Luminous\nSymbols for Healing, Roni was enlightened to how she could integrate her\nsense of color and design with her Spiritual Path. She shared her\nrealization with her Akashic Records teacher at a retreat in Texas. Mary\nencouraged Roni\\'s idea to open the Records for guidance to construct\nMandalas. Mary scrounged for some paper and colored pencils and directed\nRoni to \\"sit down and do it!\\"\n\nIn the next four days, Roni created five Mandalas. The energy was so\nstrong and magnificent that she was certain this is the Path to and from\nher heart. Within the following months Roni flew to the Santa\\`Cruz\nMountains in California to attend an intensive Mandala workshop with Dr.\nCornell. She continues her studies and exploration of Mandalas and\nsymbology on a daily basis. Roni is certain that at this interval in the\n· continuum, Mandalas are part of her Path. Some of Roni\\'s Mandalas\nhave been exhibited at the A.R.C. Gallery Education Foundation.\n\nRoni has also been a Certified Akashic Record Consultant and Teacher for\n15 years. She has been trained through the Spiritual Lineage of Akashic\nRecord Consultant International by Mary D. Parker, and is one of the\noriginal teachers. Roni has taught and given consultations all over the\nUnited States, Canada, and in South America. She sits on the Board of\nAkashic Record Consultants International, a not-for-profit organization,\nas Chairperson of Ethics and Standards.\n\n<i>Thank you so much...it is beautiful and I can \\'t wait to get it\nframed and up in its place of honor... </i> M.D. - Cicero, IL\n\n*I LOVE IT!

142	Guest Speaker:  Randolph J. Rogers	"His book, THE KEY OF LIFE, is a consciousness-raising self-help detective story that can lead you to examine the everyday details of your life." ~Peter Michalos, Author of Psyche, a Novel of the Young Freud, (Nan A Talese, Doubleday)\n\n 	Randy Rogers is the president of Telefilm, Inc., a Los Angeles-based\nproduction company handling the promotion of Hollywood blockbusters like\n*The Matrix* , *Harry Potter, Pearl Harbor, Batman, Superman, Shrek* and\n*Indiana Jones*.A career spanning four decades in newspapers, television\nand motion pictures—working for and with such companies as NBC\nNews,Disney,Warner Bros., Paramount,Universal Pictures, MGM, Lionsgate,\nSony and DreamWorks—has earned him several Emmy nominations and numerous\npress club awards.\n\nGrowing up in Johnstown, a western Pennsylvania steel town, Randy began\nhis lifelong path as a photographer when he asked for his first camera\nfrom a Green Stamps catalog on his 10th birthday. His first job, that of\na part-time usher at the State Theatre in 1969, subtly foretold where\nthat path would be heading. From that day forward, his real career would\nbe in the news and motion picture businesses.\n\nStarting with a newspaper internship at Johnstown’s Tribune-Democrat\nduring the summer of 1970, Randy progressed to television news\ncinematographer with WJAC-TV the day after his high school graduation in\n1971. Two years later, he headed west, spending thirteen years in\nPhoenix, Arizona, beginning with KPHO-TV and moving to KPNX-TV, the\nlocal NBC affiliate, picking up the Emmy nominations and press club\nawards along the way.\n\nRandy’s career was a fast-moving escalator whisking him to the top of\nhis field. His baptism in the pool of metaphysics began with breakfast\non the morning of April 23, 1986, when he read this horoscope to his\nwife: What seemed a “no exit” proposition will be brighter. You will\nhave more love and money as result. Get ready for new start. Display\npioneering spirit. “Maybe the network is going to call me today,” he\njokingly prophesied to her and then left for the office. An hour later,\nas he walked into the newsroom, the receptionist handed him a phone\nmessage: NBC News was calling to offer him a job!\n\n<i>“The Key of Life has changed my beliefs about life and death forever.\nI met Randy on Aug. 23rd and my father passed away just a few weeks\nlater, on Sept. 14th. This book eased my pain so much during this\ndifficult time. And I could not believe the significance of these dates\nwith those in the book! If you have ever even thought about the\npossibility of reincarnation, you must read this book. “ </i> ~Trudy\nClarke, Butte MT\n\n<i>“I approached Randy’s metaphysical exploration with interest. There\nwere a few surprises at the outset, the first being that I liked reading\nThe Key of Life (there were ‘good books’ on the NY Times bestseller list\nI didn’t necessarily like). The next surprise wasn’t so much a surprise\nas it was a confirmation when I discovered that Randy’s ‘hands-on’\ntestimonial to the existence of higher fields of influence would be\nabsorbing and genuine even to the hard-core disbeliever. For as far out\nand high up as the death of an old friend took him, the surer it was\nthat his budding bond with that higher spirit would lead him home to\nperception and resolution. Whatever hell Randy Rogers had to cross to\nreach his heavenly cause, he took us with him, round trip. And this\nreader felt the better for it.” </i> ~Shirley Jones, actress\n\n<i>“The Key of Life: A Metaphysical Investigation… is a very personal\nand life changing experience. We emerge from it… enlightened and\ninspired. Congratulations, what an accomplishment!” </i> ~Maria Shriver,\nFirst Lady of CA, Author of Just Who Will You Be?: Big Question, Little\nBook. Answer Within.\n\n<i>“The Key of Life is a frank, insightful chronicle of one man\\'s\nspiritual odyssey. Everyone can relate in some way to his experiences.\nWe may interpret them differently, yet Randy\\'s ability to pull us in\nand share his drama takes us, in fact, to the same spiritual home.”\n</i>~Lynda Neff, West Virginia\n\nFor more information, please go to: [\n*http://www.randolphjrogers.com/*][1]\n\n Note: Randy will be doing private one-on-one Past-Life Regressions on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, April 10, 11, and 12.

106	Guest Speaker:  Mark Macy	NDEr, Cancer Survivor, Author, Researcher on Spritual Communication\n	Mark Macy was an atheist until cancer and a resulting near-death\nexperience set him on a spiritual search in the 1980s. He was looking\nfor proof---or good, solid evidence of an afterlife, which led him to\nthe miracles of ITC, or instrumental transcommunication.\n\nResearchers claimed to be getting personal letters planted mysteriously\nin their computers by invisible hands of spirit friends. They reported\nthat faces and landscapes from the other side were flashing across their\nTV screens, and they were having actual phone dialogs with angels. Mark\nthought this all sounded a little strange, to say the least, but when he\nvisited the leading researchers in Europe, he was amazed by what he\nfound… physical evidence, veritable proof that communication was really\ngoing on between Heaven and Earth. And he\\'s immersed himself in ITC\nsince 1991.\n\nWith the use of a special subtle energy device called a \\"luminator,\\"\nhe has photographed many clear spirit faces of late colleagues, loved\nones, and celebrities, including John Denver. The results of his\nresearch can be seen on his websites and in his recent books, *Spirit\nFaces, Truth about the Afterlife,* and *Miracles in the Storm.*\n\nHe gives lectures and workshops on the afterlife, which include\ntechniques of communicating with the other side through equipment,\ncontacting spirit guides, and soliciting help from the finer realms of\nspirit to align to our spiritual purpose and personal mission for this\nlifetime. Special seminars and workshops include the luminator, with the\nintention of getting spirit faces ‘posing’ with the participants in\nPolaroid photos.\n\nPrivate, half hour sessions will be available on Sunday and Monday,\nApril 13 & 14....from 9-12 am and 2-5 pm. Each person will receive a\ncouple of photos to take home. Cost is $60 for each half hour session.\nCall 847.251.5758 for an appointment.

The results of his\nresearch can be seen on his websites and in his recent books, <em>Spirit\nFaces, Truth about the Afterlife,</em> and <em>Miracles in the Storm.</em></p>\n\n<p>He gives lectures and workshops on the afterlife, which include\ntechniques of communicating with the other side through equipment,\ncontacting spirit guides, and soliciting help from the finer realms of\nspirit to align to our spiritual purpose and personal mission for this\nlifetime. Special seminars and workshops include the luminator, with the\nintention of getting spirit faces ‘posing’ with the participants in\nPolaroid photos.</p>\n\n<p>Private, half hour sessions will be available on Sunday and Monday,\nApril 13 &amp; 14&hellip;.from 9-12 am and 2-5 pm.

31	Guest Speaker:  Carol Bowman, author, Children's Past Lives and Return From Heaven		Some very young children remember their previous lives and deaths\r\nspontaneously, without prompting or hypnosis. It is a natural phenomenon\r\nthat has profound implications for parents as well as anyone curious to\r\nknow what happens after death.\r\n\r\nCarol Bowman, author of Children\\'s Past Lives and Return From Heaven,\r\nwill share heartwarming stories that make reincarnation real and\r\npersonal. She will also describe empirical scientific research that\r\nproves the reality of these memories and provides perhaps the best\r\nevidence yet for life after death.

110	Guest Speaker:  John Lionberger	A bliss experience sent him in a new direction. Formerly an atheist, he is now a chaplain who conducts God workshops in the woods....	John Lionberger is the author of *Renewal in the Wilderness: A Spiritual\nGuide to Connecting With God in the Natural World*. His book traces the\nhistory of spiritual formation in the wilderness, which has been\nremarkably similar across the world for thousands of years, and the\nuniversality of the experience may be, as Lionberger says, “the language\nwith which we can all talk of God without shedding blood.”\n\nThe book is interspersed with accounts and lessons from his own trips\ninto the wilderness, as well as vignettes from the people who have\njoined him. When he isn’t writing, he’s taking people of any faith, and\noften no faith at all, into the wilderness on trips of spiritual and\nlife renewal. His ministry is called, appropriately, “Renewal in the\nWilderness.”\n\nOn a dog sled trip to the boundary waters in northern Minnesota, he\nbegan the adventure as a dedicated agnostic, but he left the wilderness\nknowing that he’d been ambushed by God. In the 25 degrees below zero\nweather, a warmth flooded over him that he couldn\\'t explain. Over the\nnext year and a half he concluded that he had been visited by God. It\nchanged everything for him, taking him from a thirty year career as an\nadvertising executive in the broadcast and cable businesses, to\nseminary, then to the idea of taking people into the wilderness for the\nsame kind of experience he had.\n\nRaised in South Bend, IN, Lionberger did his undergraduate work in\nEnglish at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN.

His book traces the\nhistory of spiritual formation in the wilderness, which has been\nremarkably similar across the world for thousands of years, and the\nuniversality of the experience may be, as Lionberger says, “the language\nwith which we can all talk of God without shedding blood.”</p>\n\n<p>The book is interspersed with accounts and lessons from his own trips\ninto the wilderness, as well as vignettes from the people who have\njoined him. When he isn’t writing, he’s taking people of any faith, and\noften no faith at all, into the wilderness on trips of spiritual and\nlife renewal. His ministry is called, appropriately, “Renewal in the\nWilderness.”</p>\n\n<p>On a dog sled trip to the boundary waters in northern Minnesota, he\nbegan the adventure as a dedicated agnostic, but he left the wilderness\nknowing that he’d been ambushed by God. In the 25 degrees below zero\nweather, a warmth flooded over him that he couldn\\&#39;t explain. Over the\nnext year and a half he concluded that he had been visited by God. It\nchanged everything for him, taking him from a thirty year career as an\nadvertising executive in the broadcast and cable businesses, to\nseminary, then to the idea of taking people into the wilderness for the\nsame kind of experience he had.</p>\n\n<p>Raised in South Bend, IN, Lionberger did his undergraduate work in\nEnglish at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. He earned a MSJ\ndegree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University\nin Evanston, IL, and a Master of Divinity from the Chicago Theological\nSeminary.</p>\n\n<p>He currently resides in Evanston, IL, with his wife, Jane, a\nPresbyterian minister, and he serves as the chaplain for the Three\nCrowns Park retirement home.

195	Guest Speaker: Howard Storm	One of the most extensive and life-changing NDE stories on record, a "negative" experience	Howard Storm was born in Newton, MA, in 1946 and for many years, he\r\nlived the American dream. He had a fine home, a family, and, for 20\r\nyears, a successful career as an artist and art professor at Northern\r\nKentucky University. Like many of his colleagues in the academic\r\ncommunity, he was an atheist, believing that "When you die, you die,\r\nand that's it."\r\n\r\nIn June, 1985, he took a group of his art students to Paris. Without\r\nwarning, he found himself in the hospital in excruciating pain, awaiting\r\nan emergency operation and he realized with horror that his death was a\r\nreal possibility.\r\n\r\nStorm was totally unprepared for what was to happen next. He found\r\nhimself out of his body, staring at his own physical form. But this was\r\nno hallucination; he was fully aware and felt more alive than ever\r\nbefore. In his spirit form, Storm was drawn into fearsome realms of\r\ndarkness and death, where he experienced the terrible consequences of a\r\nlife of selfishness and materialism. \r\n\r\nHowever, his journey also took him\r\ninto regions of light where he conversed with angelic beings and the\r\nLord of Light Himself, who sent him back to earth with a message of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nFollowing his near-death experience, his life was transformed. He\r\neventually studied to become a pastor and in 1992 was ordained in the\r\nUnited Church of Christ. He became pastor at Zion United Church of\r\nChrist in Cincinnati, Ohio, spent extensive time and energy helping a community in Belize, and is now retired.\r\n\r\nOn numerous occasions he has communicated the message he received from his experience to various groups and\r\nthrough the media, including the Oprah Winfrey Show, 48 hours and the\r\nDiscovery Channel. He wrote an account of his experience, "My Descent\r\ninto Death," which was published in 2000.\r\n\r\n<i> "...I consider Howard Storm's near-death experience one of the\r\ngreatest that I am aware of..." ---George Ritchie, author of "Return\r\nFrom Tomorrow" and "Ordered to Return." <i>\r\n	2015-08-08	2014-03-12 21:34:42.466421	2015-08-21 15:19:34.977493	<p>Howard Storm was born in Newton, MA, in 1946 and for many years, he\nlived the American dream.

152	Guest Speaker:  Roberta Grimes	Author, The Fun of Dying, Lawyer	NDEr, Author of *The Fun of Dying*\r\n\r\nAn accomplished professional, Roberta Grimes is a financial\r\nplanner and an attorney licensed in Massachusetts, Florida, and\r\nTexas. While money is an oft-discussed topic, Grimes is well\r\nversed in a subject not many are comfortable with:  the afterlife.  For the past 40 years, she has pored over centuries of research and accounts dealing with death. \r\n\r\nFrom her first experience with the “other side” at age 8, Grimes has immersed herself in all she could find on the topic.\r\nWhile many find the reality of death grim, Roberta Grimes has\r\ndiscovered the hopeful truth about the afterlife, and has set out to help others see this, too. \r\n\r\nHer new, uplifting book, >*The Fun of\r\nDying: Find Out What Really Happens Next! * (Greater Reality\r\nPublications, 978-0-9802111-1-5, 2010, $14.95) explains the reality of what happens before, during and after death.\r\n“For most people, dying is the great unknown,” Grimes says. “So for most, this universal trip is as scary\r\nas sailing used to be when the flat Earth had edges and the sea was full of dragons.”\r\n\r\nRoberta recently helped to found afterlifeforums.com, which is a website for the discussion of death and spirituality from a non-religious point of view.  She hopes her conclusions on the topic can alleviate many people’s intense fear of dying, and can help the grieving cope better with their loss. Using her knowledge of the other side, she aims to spread the\r\npositive reality of death, changing lives as she explains how after death life is, indeed, fun.\r\n\r\nBorn in Worcester, Mass., Grimes is a graduate of Smith College and Boston University School of Law.  She continues to practice small-business law in Massachusetts and Texas.  She has been happily married for 39 years, and she enjoys her three adult children and four young grandchildren.   Roberta says that her family “tolerates” her obsession with death, but when she wants to talk about it they change the subject! \r\n\r\n\r\n	2012-02-11	2011-08-06 03:42:28.839994	2012-02-19 15:14:19.471579	<p>NDEr, Author of <em>The Fun of Dying</em></p>\n\n<p>An accomplished professional, Roberta Grimes is a financial\nplanner and an attorney licensed in Massachusetts, Florida, and\nTexas.

For the past 40 years, she has pored over centuries of research and accounts dealing with death. </p>\n\n<p>From her first experience with the “other side” at age 8, Grimes has immersed herself in all she could find on the topic.\nWhile many find the reality of death grim, Roberta Grimes has\ndiscovered the hopeful truth about the afterlife, and has set out to help others see this, too. </p>\n\n<p>Her new, uplifting book, &gt;*The Fun of\nDying: Find Out What Really Happens Next! * (Greater Reality\nPublications, 978-0-9802111-1-5, 2010, $14.95) explains the reality of what happens before, during and after death.\n“For most people, dying is the great unknown,” Grimes says. “So for most, this universal trip is as scary\nas sailing used to be when the flat Earth had edges and the sea was full of dragons.”</p>\n\n<p>Roberta recently helped to found afterlifeforums.com, which is a website for the discussion of death and spirituality from a non-religious point of view.  She hopes her conclusions on the topic can alleviate many people’s intense fear of dying, and can help the grieving cope better with their loss. Using her knowledge of the other side, she aims to spread the\npositive reality of death, changing lives as she explains how after death life is, indeed, fun.</p>\n\n<p>Born in Worcester, Mass., Grimes is a graduate of Smith College and Boston University School of Law.  She continues to practice small-business law in Massachusetts and Texas.  She has been happily married for 39 years, and she enjoys her three adult children and four young grandchildren.   Roberta says that her family “tolerates” her obsession with death, but when she wants to talk about it they change the subject! </p>\n	t

163	Guest Speaker:   Toni Ann Winninger	NDEr, Channeler, Author of 7 books about the other side....	From medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, I always sought “The Answer.” In those days I had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present my perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly. \r\n\r\nIn those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist. If a motive or alibi could not be documented, I didn’t want to hear it. My left brain, the hard-drive calculator part of me, was in charge. Never feeling emotions because they got in the way of deduction, I could not accept something based upon hearsay—how would I ever prove to someone else beyond a reasonable doubt that a non-physical energy or an emotion had an impact upon the physical?\r\n\r\nThen one day, while walking my dog in the forest preserve, I heard a voice say, “Why do you hate yourself?” Now, with such a rational background, you would think that my first reaction would be to ignore any voice since it was quite evident that the only two physical beings in those trees were the dog and me—but I didn’t. Although I saw no one, I did feel a presence, so I followed usual court behavior and started arguing with the voice: It was wrong; I didn’t hate myself; where did you ever get such an idea? Back and forth we went until quite exhausted. Then came a new question: “Well then, let’s start with what you don’t like about yourself.” The flood gates burst open and, for the first time in my life, I let my emotions out.\r\n\r\nThat simple walk in the woods started an inner search for the real Toni Ann Winninger. Who was I really? What was I hiding deep inside? What was I running away from? And on, and on, and on, until I began to walk down my soul’s spiritual pathway. I envied people who could communicate with their guides. Raised Catholic, I was pretty sure there were such things as guardian angels—the nuns used to give me little cards with their pictures on them. A mentor of mine, through hypnotherapy, then helped me open my doors to my personal guides, which started a dialogue that continues to this day.\r\n\r\nWhile I was getting ready to retire from my position as a senior criminal prosecuting trial attorney with the Cook County (Chicago) State’s Attorney’s Office, my guides recruited me to be their voice to the world. I did not even know what a channeler was when they told me they wanted me to convey their messages to others. Now I translate messages from them weekly and place them on the website they had us construct for that purpose.\r\n\r\nDo I know “beyond a reasonable doubt” that these spiritual guides exist? Absolutely! During my years of doing readings for people, they have delivered messages through me, time and again, which I have seen create positive change in people’s lives. They constantly give me information, the truth of which I have absolutely no way of knowing, yet I do know with certainty now because I can feel their energy, their sincerity, their mirth, and best of all, their unconditional love for all of us incarnate here on planet Earth. \r\n\r\nThe Masters of the Spirit World simply ask me to take the energetic vibrations that they send through me and tune them, translate them, for all the world to have. What are you to do with those words? The same as I do. You must use your freedom of choice to feel whether they should be part of your reality, and if so, then you may embrace them as I embrace my work for the non-physical, wonderful beings at Home on the other side.\r\n\r\nI had my first NDE during a tonsillectomy at the age of 7, it scared me because of an emergency with another patient just as I was coming back. My next one occurred at 15 when I dove off a cliff, slipped launching myself, propelling me into an overhang. I had a life review and a lot of things felt different afterwards. Shortly thereafter I was talked out of most of my feelings by the nuns in high school. Everything became very physically judgmental until the above incident. Since then I have had OBEs and constant contact with the non-physical world.\r\n\r\nI have channeled seven books and two pamphlets and am working on an eighth. I travel the world doing channeling, presenting workshops, and teaching self-help spiritual enlightenment courses. I have been working in Singapore, Hong Kong, all over Malaysia, all over the United Kingdom and in Paris. I have Skype and phone clients all over the world including Germany, Brazil, Spain, Australia, Costa Rico just to mention a few.   \r\n\r\nToni Ann Winninger\r\n\r\nwww.mastersofthespiritworld.com\r\n	2013-01-12	2012-02-04 21:51:08.611457	2013-02-01 22:13:02.005443	<p>From medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, I always sought “The Answer.” In those days I had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present my perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly. </p>\n\n<p>In those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist.

167	Guest Speaker:  Laura Alden Kamm	NDEr, Well-known energetic healer, Author, Teacher, and Intuitive	Laura grew up in rural Ohio. A world traveler at a young age, she tromped through 16 countries by the time she was 8. After high school, Laura headed to the Ohio State University. Shortly thereafter, she ended up working at the headquarters for the Commander-in-Chief for the North Atlantic Fleet. She married, had two children, and continued to pursue a scholarly vision of creating architecture with an anthropological influence which would infuse the work of her heroes—Margaret Mead, Joseph Campbell, and Frank Lloyd Wright.\r\n\r\nWhile attending Indiana State University in 1982, Laura’s life was transformed when she awoke one morning with a searing pain in her head. Within 11 days she was totally blind. Several hours later, she died in an ambulance.\r\n\r\nLaura crossed over to the Other Side and had an extraordinary near-death experience. Her life and mission were forever changed. She recovered from this traumatic illness, partially blind and with a rare and precise gift of inner sight. She described to her neurosurgeon how she physically saw particles and ribbons of colors within and around everything, to which he replied, “Laura, it will be 100 years before Western science finds out what really happened to you.”\r\n\r\nEarly on, a schism formed between her experiences and skills, and the mainstream world. Laura felt far-flung from what life was supposed to be. But what was life supposed to be? She saw a black hole between science, religion, philosophy, and contemporary spirituality and mysticism. There is an unwillingness to speak of one’s direct experiences with God that fall outside the lines of acceptable dogma. She began to envision intelligent, compassionate conversations about living with hope and fulfillment in our flattening world while being consciously engaged in spirituality and its inherently beautiful, yet, challenging experiences.\r\n\r\nHer book, Intuitive Wellness, and audio programs, Unlocking Your Intuitive Power: How to Read the Energy of Anything and Color Intuition, begin to address the questions she asked as a child—who or what is God?  For almost thirty years she has engaged in work that keeps her in direct contact with spirituality, never losing her thirst for discovering cross-cultural applications of religion and mysticism, and exploring how science has been empowered to make or break a spiritual point but cannot diminishing one’s personal experience.\r\n\r\nAs a structural and medical intuitive, she has worked with countless individuals around the world, from all strata of society. Doctors have called Laura a “walking MRI” for her laser-like accuracy in intuitive assessments. She is a popular radio guest and the host of, Laura Kamm Live; words along the way. She has served on research panels, including the National Institute of Health-funded studies on remote healing with HIV/AIDs patients. Laura has also worked with the complementary medicine unit at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Her work has been highlighted in Body + Soul and Better Health and Living magazines, and she is the “Intuitive Development Expert” for Sounds True web channel.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura is not writing, lecturing, teaching, on the radio, or working with private clients, she relishes time spent with her two adult children. She is a life-long student of anthropology/sociology, a gardener, and a practitioner of meditation, yoga, and various eastern arts, including calligraphy.\r\n	2013-05-11	2012-03-31 00:21:34.32797	2012-10-04 22:40:05.177844	<p>Laura grew up in rural Ohio.

171	Guest Speaker:  Toni Winninger	NDEr, Channeler, Author of 7 books about the other side....An open channeling during our meeting...come and participate in this close connection with the other side.	\r\n\r\nFrom medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, I always sought “The Answer.” In those days I had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present my perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly.\r\n\r\nIn those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist. If a motive or alibi could not be documented, I didn’t want to hear it. My left brain, the hard-drive calculator part of me, was in charge. Never feeling emotions because they got in the way of deduction, I could not accept something based upon hearsay—how would I ever prove to someone else beyond a reasonable doubt that a non-physical energy or an emotion had an impact upon the physical?\r\n\r\nThen one day, while walking my dog in the forest preserve, I heard a voice say, “Why do you hate yourself?” Now, with such a rational background, you would think that my first reaction would be to ignore any voice since it was quite evident that the only two physical beings in those trees were the dog and me—but I didn’t. Although I saw no one, I did feel a presence, so I followed usual court behavior and started arguing with the voice: It was wrong; I didn’t hate myself; where did you ever get such an idea? Back and forth we went until quite exhausted. Then came a new question: “Well then, let’s start with what you don’t like about yourself.” The flood gates burst open and, for the first time in my life, I let my emotions out.\r\n\r\nThat simple walk in the woods started an inner search for the real Toni Ann Winninger. Who was I really? What was I hiding deep inside? What was I running away from? And on, and on, and on, until I began to walk down my soul’s spiritual pathway. I envied people who could communicate with their guides. Raised Catholic, I was pretty sure there were such things as guardian angels—the nuns used to give me little cards with their pictures on them. A mentor of mine, through hypnotherapy, then helped me open my doors to my personal guides, which started a dialogue that continues to this day.\r\n\r\nWhile I was getting ready to retire from my position as a senior criminal prosecuting trial attorney with the Cook County (Chicago) State’s Attorney’s Office, my guides recruited me to be their voice to the world. I did not even know what a channeler was when they told me they wanted me to convey their messages to others. Now I translate messages from them weekly and place them on the website they had us construct for that purpose.\r\n\r\nDo I know “beyond a reasonable doubt” that these spiritual guides exist? Absolutely! During my years of doing readings for people, they have delivered messages through me, time and again, which I have seen create positive change in people’s lives. They constantly give me information, the truth of which I have absolutely no way of knowing, yet I do know with certainty now because I can feel their energy, their sincerity, their mirth, and best of all, their unconditional love for all of us incarnate here on planet Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Masters of the Spirit World simply ask me to take the energetic vibrations that they send through me and tune them, translate them, for all the world to have. What are you to do with those words? The same as I do. You must use your freedom of choice to feel whether they should be part of your reality, and if so, then you may embrace them as I embrace my work for the non-physical, wonderful beings at Home on the other side.\r\n\r\nI had my first NDE during a tonsillectomy at the age of 7, it scared me because of an emergency with another patient just as I was coming back. My next one occurred at 15 when I dove off a cliff, slipped launching myself, propelling me into an overhang. I had a life review and a lot of things felt different afterwards. Shortly thereafter I was talked out of most of my feelings by the nuns in high school. Everything became very physically judgmental until the above incident. Since then I have had OBEs and constant contact with the non-physical world.\r\n\r\nI have channeled seven books and two pamphlets and am working on an eighth. I travel the world doing channeling, presenting workshops, and teaching self-help spiritual enlightenment courses. I have been working in Singapore, Hong Kong, all over Malaysia, all over the United Kingdom and in Paris. I have Skype and phone clients all over the world including Germany, Brazil, Spain, Australia, Costa Rico just to mention a few.\r\n\r\nToni Ann Winninger\r\n\r\nwww.mastersofthespiritworld.com\r\n\r\nToni will be doing private readings on Sunday afternoon, Monday and Tuesday.

172	Guest Speaker:  Michael Tamura	3 NDEs; Celebrated Spiritual Teacher, Visionary Clairvoyant & Award-Winning Author of YOU ARE THE ANSWER	Michael Tamura lives the miracle:  Spiritually aware from childhood, he sees everyone the way they are as immortal souls.  To guide thousands to their healing, awakening, and true life purpose, he draws from years of intensive training, profound past-life recall, nightly out-of-the-body teaching sojourns, and a lifetime of extraordinary experiences, including having physically died twice in full consciousness.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in Japan, yet educated in American schools, Michael has spent a lifetime bridging gaps:  Not only between East and West, but between men and women, the young and old, heart and soul, life and the afterlife---and, above all, between humanity and divinity.  He is beloved around the world as a spiritual teacher, visionary clairvoyant, and pioneer of healing and psychic development.  \r\n\r\nHe has been featured on CNN, NBC's The Leeza Show, Bridging Heaven & Earth, The Aware Show, Hay House Radio, World Puja Network, and many other media programs.   He was also included in ABCNews' The Century:  America's Time with Peter Jennings.  Currently in production is a documentary film featuring Michael and his three profound death experiences.\r\n\r\nA long-time champion for a soul-centered education, healing, and parenting of children and youth, Michael was a guest expert in the film, *The Indigo Evolution* and has been a contributing writer for the Childen of the New Earth Magazine and other publications.   He also wrote the final chapter, "Nourishing the Soul of the Psychic Child" in James Twyman's book, *Messages From Thomas:  Raising Psychic Children.*  He serves as a consultant to CosmiKids and for other pioneers in the education and healing of children.\r\n\r\nToday, the award-winning author of YOU ARE THE ANSWER, is working on his latest book, *THREE TIMES DEAD and What It Taught Me: A Journey Into the Heart of Wisdom*,\r\nas he continues to provide psychic tools and spiritual practices to illuminate the way home\r\nfor awakening souls. His teachings are offered through his acclaimed seminars, teleclass courses, writing, media appearances, special events, and audio products.  For Michael, every step in life offers an opportunity for healing, miracles, and the fulfillment of one's divine purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Tamura has died three times - and returned each time with more of life to share. Although there are a growing number of case studies of those who have returned to physical life after their clinical deaths, few, if any, had been living aware of themselves as immortal souls, regularly teaching out-of-the-body spiritually, and practicing how to die correctly for years prior to their death or near-death experiences. Michael had been consciously doing all of these things and more as a spiritual teacher, healer, and clairvoyant visionary for over 32 years by the time that he had his first experience of physically dying in 2006.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 2011, while he was at his gym working out on the elliptical machine, he dropped dead for his third time - his heart just stopped. The first medical responder later told him that he had less than a 4% chance of survival even after the paramedics were able to kick-start his heart some ten minutes after he was found on the floor without a pulse. While Michael was in emergency surgery, doctors, nurses, and even a priest told his wife that if he should survive, he would not be the same man she knew - he would be brain damaged. Only a faith healer, a friend, coming out of a deep prayer healing session\r\ntold his wife, “The Holy Spirit said that Michael will return with no brain damage at all.”  \r\n\r\nMichael Tamura did return for a third time, mentally not only intact, but, even more aware and inspired. When first asked what he would like to say to everyone awaiting word from him, he laughed and said, “The body gets all the press, but, it’s the spirit that matters.” He will surely bring much wit and wisdom into his inspiring talk on choosing how to die, the practice of dying, and what it means to live the miracle as an immortal soul while we are still incarnated in this world.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see http://www.michaeltamura.com/	2013-06-08	2012-10-08 04:07:47.743126	2013-06-24 06:16:16.956411	<p>Michael Tamura lives the miracle:  Spiritually aware from childhood, he sees everyone the way they are as immortal souls.

193	Guest Speaker:   Dennis Markowitz	A Very Gifted Healer, Dennis is returning due to popular demand and a family emergency for Sharla Rae Jahnke.   There is no one like Dennis.  Don't miss him!	\r\nDennis Markowitz prefers to be called a "Facilitator" as opposed to a "Healer."    He is adamant that he is not the one doing the healing, but rather the one who facilitates the loving Divine energy of which we are all constructed and repaired.   His intention is to relieve/eliminate discomfort, pain and suffering.\r\n\r\nMr. Markowitz' initial studies were at the California School of Massage Therapy, where he received a Holistic Health Practitioner Degree.  In 1993, he began his Holistic Health practice under the name *California Body Care*.   He then continued studies in Reiki and Sukyo Mahikari and eventually, in 2005, he was privileged to begin his studies in Pranic Healing under the very esteemed and knowledgable founder of Pranic Healing, Grand Master Choa Kok Sui and his disciple, Master Stephen Co.  He graduated in 2006 with an Associate Pranic Healing Certificate.\r\n\r\nSince then, he has also become a Certified Pranic Instructor and Lecturer for doctors, nurses, therapists as well as a facilitator for the general public.

202	Movies, Movies, Movies	Two Fabulous Full-length Feature Films. Both of these movies are entertaining and informative…Bring your own popcorn…no intermission. First movie begins promptly at 2 pm. 	BEYOND DEATH (2000) - Mainstream researchers, mediums and those who have had near-death experiences help explore the eternal mystery of what awaits us when we die.  We are all destined to die, and there is no escape. But perhaps it is this inevitability that inspires us to continually seek answers to the question: WHAT HAPPENS BEYOND DEATH? \r\n\r\nThis feature-length film explores the eternal enigma from every angle, meeting with everyone from mainstream scientific researchers to mediums in search of insight into what is in store for us. Skeptics detail their arguments. \r\n\r\nA dramatic and vivid counterpoint is provided by several people who have had near-death experiences, and their extraordinary tales are pointed to by others as proof that there is indeed another chapter to be written after we pass away. Probing and illuminating, this is an extraordinary journey into a realm that has captured the human imagination for millennia - the quest for the afterlife.\r\n\r\nDon't miss this fabulous, hard-to-find film!  90 minutes.\r\n\r\nDEFENDING YOUR LIFE (1991) - In an afterlife resembling the present-day US, people must prove their worth by showing in court how they have demonstrated courage.  This is a very funny dramatization of the "Life Review."  Except for the obvious allusions to modern life, the actual process seems very much in line with what near-death experiencers report on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nDirector: Albert Brooks\r\nWriter: Albert Brooks\r\nStars: Albert Brooks, Meryl Streep, Rip Torn \r\n112 minutes	2016-03-12	2014-10-04 04:46:44.202264	2016-01-14 00:12:09.244285	<p>BEYOND DEATH (2000) - Mainstream researchers, mediums and those who have had near-death experiences help explore the eternal mystery of what awaits us when we die.

181	Guest Speaker:  PMH Atwater	World reknown researcher, intuitive, speaker, speaks about CHILDREN OF THE FIFTH WORLD:  A GUIDE TO THE COMING CHANGES IN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS. Author of many books.	\r\n _Children of the Fifth World_ takes a broad and deep look at today’s kids and why they are so different.  Tossing aside labels like indigo, crystal, starseed, rainbow, and psychic, near-death researcher P. M. H. Atwater connects esoteric traditions of the Fifth Root Race (a particular genetic patterning in the evolution of the human race), and predictions of rising Fifth World energies, with what is actually occurring in the world today.\r\n \r\nShe explains how the increase in intuitive, creative, and abstract thinking abilities of children, as well as incidences of ADHD, dyslexia, and autism signal evolutionary changes at work – the emergence of the Fifth Root Race.  She connects the appearance of these traits with ancient myths and the predictions of visionary seers.  The new kids act as agents for world change by reflecting back every misguided aspect of business, politics, religion, and culture. \r\n \r\nDr. Atwater walks you through “what’s happening” and “how to handle it” in ways always clear and to the point.  She uncovers and outlines linear and cyclic timetables in the grand sweep of what is called “The Great Shifting.”  No sacred cows are left uncovered, as she seeks to bridge heartbreak with promise in our newest generations. \r\n \r\nThis project was inspired by her research of child experiencers of near-death states.  She noticed that children born naturally from regular parents were exhibiting the same or similar traits to near-death kids, including synesthesia.  Since this is clearly impossible, she considered evolutionary factors.  When she did, not only did the traits match but so did the historical “upgrades” that influenced all the world’s various renaissances, the inception of the New Thought Movement, and the other sweeping shifts into states of higher consciousness that we have record of. \r\n \r\nBooks will be available at this talk that reference her work in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\nBio:\r\n\r\nBorn in Twin Falls, Idaho, Atwater married young and became a mother of three, Sunday School teacher, secretary, and prize winning cook. A handwriting analysis in the mid-sixties led to a complete career and life-style change. She was redirected into public service and innovative project development and analysis. \r\n\r\nParalleling this change she began intensive research into paranormal and altered states of consciousness.\r\nWith a professional background in hypnotic past-life regressions, sensitivity work, dehaunting houses, and mediumship, she came to specialize in aura massage, astrology, numerology, dream and symbol interpretation, rune casting, divinatory and earth energy sensing.\r\n\r\n1977 set the stage for severe health traumas resulting in death and the near-death experience phenomenon, three times in three months. The following year, in an effort to understand what had happened to her and was still happening, she began to seek out and interview other near-death survivors. \r\n\r\nShe is one of the original researchers in the field of near-death studies, having begun her work in 1978, and is a pioneer in subjects like near-death experiences, the after effects of spiritual experiences, transformations of consciousness, reality shifts, future memory, and modern generations of children and how they differ from previous generations. \r\n\r\nHer initial findings about the aftereffects of near-death were published in Vital Signs magazine, 1981-85, and later became “COMING BACK TO LIFE: THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE”. After over fifteen years of intensive research, interviewing over 3,000 near-death survivors, her book “BEYOND THE LIGHT, WHAT ISN'T BElNG SAID ABOUT THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERlENCE”, represents the most complete compendium yet done of the phenomenon, its aftereffects and implications.\r\n\r\nAn international authority on near-death states, she has served two terms on the Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. With the help of David Morgan, she produced the world's first positive/negative, 360-degree compendium of the entire near-death phenomenon. Titled “THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES,” this 480-page Macmillan edition debuted March/April, 2000. It is now been renamed as "The Big Book of Near-Death Experiences."\r\n\r\nAtwater has received numerous awards during her life. She earned her Letters of the Humanities (L.H.D.) doctorate from the International College of Spiritual and Psychic Studies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1992; and was awarded an honorary Ph.D. in Therapeutic Counseling in March 2005, from Medicina Alternativa Institute. Also in 2005, the International Association for Near-death Studies (IANDS) presented her with an Outstanding Service Award and the National Association of Transpersonal Hypnotherapists awarded her a Lifetime Achievement Award. She has been a Prayer Chaplain since 2004.\r\n\r\nSome of her findings have now been clinically verified in prospective studies, including “The Lancet” medical journal 12-15-01, in a paper by Pim van Lommel, a Dutch cardiologist. She has lectured at the United Nations and at many other international gatherings, large and small. Her writings have appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers. She has been on such television talk shows as Sally Jessy Raphael, Larry King Live, Entertainment Tonight, Regis & Kathy Lee, Geraldo, and The Shirley Show in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#Works published:\r\n1.P.M.H.

Tossing aside labels like indigo, crystal, starseed, rainbow, and psychic, near-death researcher P. M. H. Atwater connects esoteric traditions of the Fifth Root Race (a particular genetic patterning in the evolution of the human race), and predictions of rising Fifth World energies, with what is actually occurring in the world today.</p>\n\n<p>She explains how the increase in intuitive, creative, and abstract thinking abilities of children, as well as incidences of ADHD, dyslexia, and autism signal evolutionary changes at work – the emergence of the Fifth Root Race.  She connects the appearance of these traits with ancient myths and the predictions of visionary seers.  The new kids act as agents for world change by reflecting back every misguided aspect of business, politics, religion, and culture. </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Atwater walks you through “what’s happening” and “how to handle it” in ways always clear and to the point.  She uncovers and outlines linear and cyclic timetables in the grand sweep of what is called “The Great Shifting.”  No sacred cows are left uncovered, as she seeks to bridge heartbreak with promise in our newest generations. </p>\n\n<p>This project was inspired by her research of child experiencers of near-death states.  She noticed that children born naturally from regular parents were exhibiting the same or similar traits to near-death kids, including synesthesia.  Since this is clearly impossible, she considered evolutionary factors.  When she did, not only did the traits match but so did the historical “upgrades” that influenced all the world’s various renaissances, the inception of the New Thought Movement, and the other sweeping shifts into states of higher consciousness that we have record of. </p>\n\n<p>Books will be available at this talk that reference her work in this area.</p>\n\n<p>Bio:</p>\n\n<p>Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, Atwater married young and became a mother of three, Sunday School teacher, secretary, and prize winning cook. A handwriting analysis in the mid-sixties led to a complete career and life-style change. She was redirected into public service and innovative project development and analysis. </p>\n\n<p>Paralleling this change she began intensive research into paranormal and altered states of consciousness.\nWith a professional background in hypnotic past-life regressions, sensitivity work, dehaunting houses, and mediumship, she came to specialize in aura massage, astrology, numerology, dream and symbol interpretation, rune casting, divinatory and earth energy sensing.</p>\n\n<p>1977 set the stage for severe health traumas resulting in death and the near-death experience phenomenon, three times in three months. The following year, in an effort to understand what had happened to her and was still happening, she began to seek out and interview other near-death survivors. </p>\n\n<p>She is one of the original researchers in the field of near-death studies, having begun her work in 1978, and is a pioneer in subjects like near-death experiences, the after effects of spiritual experiences, transformations of consciousness, reality shifts, future memory, and modern generations of children and how they differ from previous generations. </p>\n\n<p>Her initial findings about the aftereffects of near-death were published in Vital Signs magazine, 1981-85, and later became “COMING BACK TO LIFE: THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE”. After over fifteen years of intensive research, interviewing over 3,000 near-death survivors, her book “BEYOND THE LIGHT, WHAT ISN&rsquo;T BElNG SAID ABOUT THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERlENCE”, represents the most complete compendium yet done of the phenomenon, its aftereffects and implications.</p>\n\n<p>An international authority on near-death states, she has served two terms on the Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. With the help of David Morgan, she produced the world&rsquo;s first positive/negative, 360-degree compendium of the entire near-death phenomenon. Titled “THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES,” this 480-page Macmillan edition debuted March/April, 2000. It is now been renamed as &ldquo;The Big Book of Near-Death Experiences.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Atwater has received numerous awards during her life. She earned her Letters of the Humanities (L.H.D.) doctorate from the International College of Spiritual and Psychic Studies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1992; and was awarded an honorary Ph.D. in Therapeutic Counseling in March 2005, from Medicina Alternativa Institute. Also in 2005, the International Association for Near-death Studies (IANDS) presented her with an Outstanding Service Award and the National Association of Transpersonal Hypnotherapists awarded her a Lifetime Achievement Award. She has been a Prayer Chaplain since 2004.</p>\n\n<p>Some of her findings have now been clinically verified in prospective studies, including “The Lancet” medical journal 12-15-01, in a paper by Pim van Lommel, a Dutch cardiologist. She has lectured at the United Nations and at many other international gatherings, large and small. Her writings have appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers. She has been on such television talk shows as Sally Jessy Raphael, Larry King Live, Entertainment Tonight, Regis &amp; Kathy Lee, Geraldo, and The Shirley Show in Canada.</p>\n\n<h1>Works published:</h1>\n\n<p>1.P.M.H.

Jenniffer Weigel is a Chicago television personality, author and performer who owns her own Chicago-area production company. She hosted *Taste*, a program aired on NBC affiliates both in New York and in Chicago and now writes a column for the Chicago Tribune. She appears on WGN Television and CLTV in Chicago to discuss her columns as the emcee of Trib University. \r\n\r\nWeigel graduated from Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois and earned a bachelor's degree in theater from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1992.\r\n\r\nWeigel began her professional career as an actress, appearing in productions at The Second City Northwest, the Wisdom Bridge Theatre and the National Jewish Theater. She also performed voiceover work.  Over the next several years, she worked as a traffic reporter, a news anchor,  and an entertainment reporter for WGN-TV in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Weigel and her husband, Clay Champlin, began co-hosting a Saturday evening radio show on WCKG-FM in Chicago. From 2002 until 2003, Weigel co-hosted a Saturday afternoon talk show on WLS-AM in Chicago. She continues to occasionally work as a fill-in radio host on WGN-AM in Chicago.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, Weigel began working as a free-lance entertainment contributor for WBBM-TV in Chicago. In 2000, she won the job on a full-time basis, and in 2001, she won a Chicago Emmy award for her feature reporting. In 2002, Weigel asked for an early release from her contract with the station after being reassigned to general news reporting duties. \r\n\r\nAfter that, Weigel did some free-lance television reporting for ABC News' Chicago bureau and did some commercial and voiceover work. She also formed her own production company, JCW Productions, in 2002. In 2005, she began hosting and producing a weekly lifestyle magazine show on WMAQ-TV in Chicago called *Taste*.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Weigel published her first book, *Stay Tuned; Conversations With Dad From the Other Side*, a book about her relationship with her late sportscaster father Tim Weigel and her spiritual attempts to contact him after his death. \r\n\r\nThe next year, Weigel adapted the book into a one-woman show called *I'm Spiritual, Dammit!* at the Viaduct Theatre in Chicago.

Her sense of humor reminds us that even though staying on the spiritual path has its fair share of challenges, you are not alone, and you will laugh again—dammit! \r\n\r\nAs a journalist, she remains cynical when gurus such as Wayne Dyer tell her to “embrace the Universe”—but the signs from something bigger keep showing up just in time.\r\nEach chapter of “This Isn’t the Life I Ordered..” delivers a nugget of wisdom that will leave you inspired and entertained. Jenniffer shows the human side of trying to be spiritual, with several laughs and poignant lessons along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeigel also has had several acting roles since beginning her television and radio career.

183	Guest Speaker:  Carol Lynn Vengroff	NDEr, Author, Creative artist, and healer....	Author and speaker Carol Vengroff grew up on Long Island, New York, in the 1950’s and 1960’s. Her father was a career pilot in the Air Force, and part of Carol’s childhood was spent in France. Carol’s mother (and personal hero) devoted her time to raising six active and highly accomplished children.\r\n\r\nAfter studying fine arts at the Pratt Institute in New York City, Carol lived in Alaska and Hawaii. She returned to the East Coast, where she was the successful business owner of American Handcraft Galleries in Boston and New York.\r\n\r\nCarol is an accomplished artist and illustrator, whose creations range from greeting cards, soft sculptures and wearable art to paintings, boat interiors and theater design. \r\nCarol’s versatile and visionary spirit translates to every aspect of her life. Nothing is safe from her recycling zeal, and unwanted objects often find themselves reinvented as clever art pieces, party decorations and yard ornaments.\r\n\r\nCarol met her husband, Harvey, in 1982 and together they raised a blended family of five children. Countless RV adventures with children and grandchildren, extensive world travels and over thirty years of cruising coastal waters on their sailboat, “Lollipop,” are all documented in Carol’s carefully illustrated journals.\r\n\r\nFor much of her life, Carol was fascinated by alternative healing methods. She trained in The Silva Method, Reiki, Healing Hands International Inc., Lightworkers Healing Method, Animal Communication LLC and Emotion Code.\r\n\r\nHer spiritual journey began in France in 1963 when she had a profound near-death experience at age 12. Carol’s first book, *My Ever After Chronicles*, is the story of her passage to heaven and back and the powerful inner awakening that followed. Carol currently speaks about her near-death experience to an international audience and is a frequent radio guest.\r\n\r\nCarol Vengroff is part of a growing collective of spiritual luminaries who are now stepping forward to share their accounts of the near-death experience and a universal message of unconditional love. \r\n\r\nCarol recognizes the transformation of human consciousness that is taking place on a global level. Her personal commitment is to serve the evolutionary process of awakening and the remembrance of the Light within.\r\n\r\nCarol and her husband currently reside on the Gulf coast of Florida. She is also co-author of the upcoming book, *Heaven 101*, with New York Times Bestselling author, media personality and spiritual champion, Kelly Lange.\r\n\r\nCarol writes: \r\n\r\n>Many experts say that your religious beliefs, your expectations, your cultural influences shape your experience of Heaven.\r\n\r\n>As a twelve year old,  my childhood would be changed forever, because that is when I personally experienced. . . Heaven.\r\n\r\n>As a child, I  believed that  Heaven was a glowing city in the clouds, with  pearly white gates, streets paved  in gold and  angels in  flowing  gowns sitting on big puffy  clouds playing harps  and singing celestial songs.  God would be seated  on a golden throne, white hair, long  beard and white toga would be all aglow  with Jesus standing by, dressed in white too. Only his hair would be long and light  brown and he would have golden staff  and lambs by his feet.\r\n\r\n>Was I ever in for a surprise!\r\n\r\n>If  what the experts say is true, than I should have experienced my childhood vision  of Heaven when I died. Instead  my Heaven was light-years from  my  religious beliefs, \r\nchild-like expectations and cultural influences.

Her father was a career pilot in the Air Force, and part of Carol’s childhood was spent in France. Carol’s mother (and personal hero) devoted her time to raising six active and highly accomplished children.</p>\n\n<p>After studying fine arts at the Pratt Institute in New York City, Carol lived in Alaska and Hawaii. She returned to the East Coast, where she was the successful business owner of American Handcraft Galleries in Boston and New York.</p>\n\n<p>Carol is an accomplished artist and illustrator, whose creations range from greeting cards, soft sculptures and wearable art to paintings, boat interiors and theater design. \nCarol’s versatile and visionary spirit translates to every aspect of her life. Nothing is safe from her recycling zeal, and unwanted objects often find themselves reinvented as clever art pieces, party decorations and yard ornaments.</p>\n\n<p>Carol met her husband, Harvey, in 1982 and together they raised a blended family of five children. Countless RV adventures with children and grandchildren, extensive world travels and over thirty years of cruising coastal waters on their sailboat, “Lollipop,” are all documented in Carol’s carefully illustrated journals.</p>\n\n<p>For much of her life, Carol was fascinated by alternative healing methods. She trained in The Silva Method, Reiki, Healing Hands International Inc., Lightworkers Healing Method, Animal Communication LLC and Emotion Code.</p>\n\n<p>Her spiritual journey began in France in 1963 when she had a profound near-death experience at age 12. Carol’s first book, <em>My Ever After Chronicles</em>, is the story of her passage to heaven and back and the powerful inner awakening that followed. Carol currently speaks about her near-death experience to an international audience and is a frequent radio guest.</p>\n\n<p>Carol Vengroff is part of a growing collective of spiritual luminaries who are now stepping forward to share their accounts of the near-death experience and a universal message of unconditional love. </p>\n\n<p>Carol recognizes the transformation of human consciousness that is taking place on a global level. Her personal commitment is to serve the evolutionary process of awakening and the remembrance of the Light within.</p>\n\n<p>Carol and her husband currently reside on the Gulf coast of Florida. She is also co-author of the upcoming book, <em>Heaven 101</em>, with New York Times Bestselling author, media personality and spiritual champion, Kelly Lange.</p>\n\n<p>Carol writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many experts say that your religious beliefs, your expectations, your cultural influences shape your experience of Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>As a twelve year old,  my childhood would be changed forever, because that is when I personally experienced&hellip; Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>As a child, I  believed that  Heaven was a glowing city in the clouds, with  pearly white gates, streets paved  in gold and  angels in  flowing  gowns sitting on big puffy  clouds playing harps  and singing celestial songs.  God would be seated  on a golden throne, white hair, long  beard and white toga would be all aglow  with Jesus standing by, dressed in white too. Only his hair would be long and light  brown and he would have golden staff  and lambs by his feet.</p>\n\n<p>Was I ever in for a surprise!</p>\n\n<p>If  what the experts say is true, than I should have experienced my childhood vision  of Heaven when I died. Instead  my Heaven was light-years from  my  religious beliefs, \nchild-like expectations and cultural influences. The Heaven I experienced  had never been mentioned in the world in which I grew up. I was in uncharted territory!</p>\n\n<p>There are no diplomas or degrees given out in Heaven. There really is no way of proving it exists&hellip;but it does. I was there!&ldquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n	t
174	Guest Speaker:  Ken Ross	Photographer, Son of Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross,and founder of the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Foundation, with which he works to help manage his mother's legacy.	Ken Ross, son of Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross (deceased), pioneering legend in hospice and bereavement education in the United States, and noted author of 22 books in 34 languages about death and dying, and Dr. Emanuel "Manny" Ross, was the principal care provider for his mother in the last 9 years of her life.\r\n\r\nKen was born in New York City in 1960.  In 1962 the family moved to Denver, CO, and in 1965, they moved again, traveling to Chicago, where his mother became an assistant professor of psychiatry as well as assistant director of psychiatric consultation and liaison services for the University of Chicago, and Kenneth spent the rest of his primary and high school years there.\r\n\r\nAfter high School, Ken traveled for a while and then attended Boston University and Franklin College, receiving his BA degree from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in International Economics and Political Science.  \r\n\r\nHe eventually began his photography career while residing in Sydney, Australia in 1985. His work has taken him to more than ninety-two countries, including 57 trips to Europe. In 2008 alone, he worked in Japan, The Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, India, Yemen, Dubai, Oman, Ukraine, and Romania, among others. Ross has tens of thousands of images on file with a number of stock photo agencies around the world including Viesti Associates.\r\n\r\nHis photographs have also appeared in several books published in the U.S. & Europe, including his own book project, Real Taste of Life. His work has been exhibited around the world and his work has been featured in many journals and periodicals.   He has actively worked with Through Each Others Eyes, an Arizona not-for-profit corporation, whose goal is to promote international understanding via the medium of photography.\r\n\r\nHe settled in Arizona when his father became ill and moved to Arizona in the 1980s.....He cared for his father until he passed in 1992.  In 1994 he brought his mother to Arizona after her house had been burned down in Virginia.  Once she was settled in, she suffered a series of strokes which were debilitating.  Kenneth cared for her until she passed in August 2004.   \r\n\r\nBefore she moved to Arizona, Elisabeth had hired 13 people to take care of her mail, schedule, books, etc, and when she arrived in Arizona, everything was suddenly left on Ken’s shoulders.   It was a shocking revelation to him that now he was responsible for all this.   He took control and began to really know who his mother was and continues to be.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ken founded the Elisabeth Kübler-Ross Foundation to continue to support her work and he served as President until recently.  He continues to serve on the Board of Directors and his responsibilities include handling over 80 publishers of Dr. Ross’s work, public relations, archiving her video and audio recordings, as well as preserving her research papers. While growing up, he traveled with her extensively while on her numerous foreign trips, witnessing her lectures and workshops. Ken made a series of lectures about his mother for hospices around the country in 2009.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at:  http://www.ekrfoundation.org.\r\n& www.kenrossphotography.com\r\n\r\n*“We were honored to welcome Ken Ross as our Dinner Gala Speaker at our symposium, Hand in Hand 2009.  He engaged our audience in a way that few can, with a tenderness and passion that both touched and energized all who were fortunate enough to be in attendance.” *-Lisa Curran Parenteau, BA, LMT; Marketing and Training Consultant - Center for Compassionate Touch  LLC\r\n\r\n	2013-10-12	2013-04-25 21:02:26.094587	2013-10-06 05:30:15.375143	<p>Ken Ross, son of Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross (deceased), pioneering legend in hospice and bereavement education in the United States, and noted author of 22 books in 34 languages about death and dying, and Dr. Emanuel &ldquo;Manny&rdquo; Ross, was the principal care provider for his mother in the last 9 years of her life.</p>\n\n<p>Ken was born in New York City in 1960.

173	Guest Speaker: Julia Assante, PhD	NDEr, Death and Dying expert, scholar, researcher, psychic medium, author, inspirational speaker and death counselor.	From 1977 to the present Julia has been an active professional psychic and medium. In addition to private sessions, she has taught workshops on remote viewing, healing arts and aura reading, afterdeath communication, remembering the future and reincarnational recall in the US, Canada, Germany, France and Spain, with the next one scheduled in Austria for February 2012. She has also coached physicists, medical professionals, entertainers and athletes to develop specific career-related psychic skills. She believes, however, that the real power of good psychic work is not about accurate information. It lies instead in its affect—the spontaneous revelation of a greater reality, the most important experience a person can have. Nothing brings that closer to home than afterdeath communication. Although it is a great wonder and privilege for Julia to assist the dying, officiate at funerals and contact the dead for others, what really changes people, what really heals and ends grief, what unveils the truth of immortality is making direct contact themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Julia was certified for practicing a uniquely effective type of regression therapy from AAPLE (LA), founded by Dr. Morris Netherton, work she continues today. She has been an ordained minister since 1985 of The New Seminary (NY), an Interfaith Seminary founded by Rabbi Joseph Gelberman and Sri Swami Satchidananda, where she taught for two years. In 1984, she participated in clinical tests for telepathy at Columbia University, resulting in accuracy scores high above other professional psychics. Her interest in religious beliefs and so-called magical practices, which has always been high, is fed by decades of working alongside shamans, healers and gurus from non-western traditions as well as academic research of pre- and parabiblical religions (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, Greece and Rome). She is now investigating ways a revolutionary medical device that operates on the level of quantum biology can be adapted to scientifically prove life after death.\r\n\r\nJulia Assante received her doctorate in Archaeology and Art History of the Ancient Near East from Columbia University. On invitation, she studied the cuneiform languages of Sumerian (the first known written language) and Akkadian (the first known Semitic language) at Yale. She taught at Columbia, Bryn Mawr and the University of Münster and excavated in Crete (Minoan levels) and Israel. She has given talks at major universities and conferences in the United States and Europe and has written numerous scholarly articles.\r\n\r\nHer specific area of interest is religion, magic and sexuality, three categories that were closely interconnected in antiquity. Many of her publications revise previous scholarship on the ancient Near East, especially where it concerns Innana/Ishtar and her cult. Innana in Sumerian or Ishtar in Akkadian was the goddess of sex, war and fate. She was also Mesopotamia’s longest lived and most popular deity. Under her special protection were women called harimtu’s, who previous scholars believed were prostitutes. Julia has since shown that harimtu’s were in actuality a social class for women who had no patriarchal status, meaning they did not live under the legal protection of a father, brother or husband. She has also shown that there is no evidence for fertility cults or rites in Mesopotamia, as was previously believed, nor is there any evidence for sacred prostitution, male or female.   Such concepts are grounded in seriously flawed nineteenth-century thinking, not in antiquity. Her work continues to influence other fields, such as biblical studies and Greco-Roman history. She has been named in Der Spiegel (Germany’s equivalent to Time magazine) as the leader of a movement challenging the status quo of gender scholarship in antiquity.\r\n\r\nOne of Julia’s greatest passions is how scripture and Christianity itself formed within the wider, older socio-political context of the ancient Near East. For academics like her who write ancient history from a perspective of a thousand or more years before the writing of scripture, the Bible is nearly a modern work. Although the afterlife plays an enormous role in the formation and maintenance of any religion, it was largely the denial of an afterlife that made ancient Judaism unique. By the time of Jesus’ birth, denial had spawned a myriad of Judaistic sects, such as the Essenes. These sects, which were outside official Judaism, were generally apocalyptic. For them an afterlife was only possible after the apocalypse and it was to be situated on earth.  In Chapter Seven of The Last Frontier, Julia traces the conceptions of the afterlife as they developed in the world’s oldest religions and how these conceptions kept changing in order to meet shifting socio-political aims.\r\n\r\nHer book, *The Last Frontier:  Exploring the Afterlife and Transforming Our Fear of Death*,  is an award-winning treatise on death.... “Social historian Assante, who is also a medium, has penned what may be the most important book on the enigma of death since the groundbreaking work of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross....An outstanding read.”\r\n— Publishers Weekly \r\n\r\nFor more information, please see www.juliaassante.com	2013-09-14	2013-03-27 07:14:30.716655	2013-10-22 03:48:36.575316	<p>From 1977 to the present Julia has been an active professional psychic and medium.

212	Guest Speaker:  Cary Weldy	Aligns living space with energy and purpose, Author, Healer, Architect, Interior Designer, uses Sacred Geometry...	Cary Weldy is a well-known interior designer, builder, and television personality in Chicago. For the past 15 years, he has built some of the finest homes in America, including the penthouse at the Trump Tower Chicago. Cary has appeared on multiple shows on HGTV and the Fine Living Network, hosting a hit show on "My Big Amazing Renovation". In 2012, i4Design Magazine named Cary "one of the top designers in the Midwest."While so much attention is focused on inner transformation, the masters of art and architecture, including da Vinci, Plato, Vitruvius, and the ancient Egyptian temple masters, knew the power of changing energy using secret techniques and hidden wisdom. \r\n\r\nIn his talk, Interior Designer Cary Weldy will reveal the “secrets of the masters” that you can use in your home or work area to shift the energy in your life. By using these simple techniques, you will create energy fields that can clear unwanted negative energy, transform lingering grief into joy, and even remove negative spirit energy from any space.\r\n\r\nCary will also show examples of how the Divine Feminine energy has been lost in modern culture and architecture, and how you can restore it in your spaces to empower your life. Discover the secrets of sacred numbers, sacred geometry, and specific shapes that will literally transform how you feel. Find out how to activate and balance your chakras, which is the seat of the Divine energy in your body, to energize your life and create miracles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCary Weldy is the founder and owner of Cary Weldy LLC, a design and construction firm located in Chicago.  He graduated with his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a top-ranked engineering school in the United States. Cary worked twelve years with Fortune 500 companies, including GE, Ashland, and United Technologies, prompting the writing of his first book, *Spiritual Values in the Workplace: The Soul of Success in the 21st Century*, which was released with Hay House’s Balboa Press in September 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the entrepreneurial itch, Cary left the corporate world in 2001 to start his own firm. His innovative work in design and construction has been featured in print media nationally and on television, including a number of appearances on HGTV and the Fine Living Network. His work was also featured on the hit TV show *My Big Amazing Renovation*, where he combined four condos into a single luxury home in a notable Chicago high-rise building.  In June 2012, Cary was named as “one of the best and brightest in the design industry” by i4Design Magazine.\r\n\r\nBased in Chicago, Cary has worked on design-and-build projects nationwide, including a penthouse in the Four Seasons in Austin, Texas, and a high-end nightclub in Montana.  He also completed the design and renovation of the 7,000 square-foot penthouse in the Trump Tower in Chicago.\r\n\r\nFor the last 25 years, Cary has studied the secrets of the masters of art, architecture, and energy, including da Vinci, Michelangelo, Vitruvius, Plato, and the ancient Egyptian temple masters.  He has also extensively studied various energy and healing modalities around the country since 1991, including certifications in Polarity Energy work, QiGong, Reconnective Therapy with Herwig Schoen, advanced Pranic Healing with Master Co, and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique).  In 2009, Cary began his apprenticeship in Native American traditions and shamanism with Hay House author and shaman Peter Calhoun.  With his collective studies in energy and healing modalities, Cary now incorporates the science of energy transformation into his work, creating healing and nurturing environments for clients while establishing a new standard for design and architecture.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, Cary launched a new brand called *Bovéda*, bringing the science of energy balancing and harmonization into his proprietary line of jewelry, artwork, and personal care products. He also continues to provide private consultations with individual and corporate clients.\r\n\r\nIn addition to writing, Cary Weldy speaks at conferences, conducts workshops, and appears as a guest on radio and television programs.  He is currently finishing his next book entitled *99 Ways to Harmonize Your Home*.\r\n\r\n**Private sessions with Cary will be available on Sunday and Monday, Jan 15 & 16, 2017.** \r\n\r\n**Private Sessions which will be available are:**\r\n\r\n**Energetic Balancing and Harmonization Consultation**\r\nEnergy balancing can be done on people, animals (such as pets), objects, or buildings. Some of the masters of art, architecture, and energy, such as da Vinci, Plato, and the ancient Egyptians, knew how direct various qualities of energy into objects or people. As a result, the object would begin resonating with those particular frequencies of energy, and then radiate those energy qualities. By connecting with the appropriate energies, those frequencies can begin working for you in a powerful way. \r\n\r\nUsing photos of the person, animal, or objects, Energy Designer Cary Weldy measures which energies are needed, and then infuses the image with spiritual symbols and other proprietary methods. During the process, Cary insures that the energy harmonization takes place through careful measurement. By infusing the image, the person(s), pet, or object(s) in the image literally receives those energies.\r\n\r\nWhen you bring blessings to anyone or anything in your life, that power is magnified, and it also increases in time.

For the past 15 years, he has built some of the finest homes in America, including the penthouse at the Trump Tower Chicago. Cary has appeared on multiple shows on HGTV and the Fine Living Network, hosting a hit show on &ldquo;My Big Amazing Renovation&rdquo;. In 2012, i4Design Magazine named Cary &ldquo;one of the top designers in the Midwest.&quot;While so much attention is focused on inner transformation, the masters of art and architecture, including da Vinci, Plato, Vitruvius, and the ancient Egyptian temple masters, knew the power of changing energy using secret techniques and hidden wisdom. </p>\n\n<p>In his talk, Interior Designer Cary Weldy will reveal the “secrets of the masters” that you can use in your home or work area to shift the energy in your life. By using these simple techniques, you will create energy fields that can clear unwanted negative energy, transform lingering grief into joy, and even remove negative spirit energy from any space.</p>\n\n<p>Cary will also show examples of how the Divine Feminine energy has been lost in modern culture and architecture, and how you can restore it in your spaces to empower your life. Discover the secrets of sacred numbers, sacred geometry, and specific shapes that will literally transform how you feel. Find out how to activate and balance your chakras, which is the seat of the Divine energy in your body, to energize your life and create miracles.</p>\n\n<p>Cary Weldy is the founder and owner of Cary Weldy LLC, a design and construction firm located in Chicago.  He graduated with his B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, a top-ranked engineering school in the United States. Cary worked twelve years with Fortune 500 companies, including GE, Ashland, and United Technologies, prompting the writing of his first book, <em>Spiritual Values in the Workplace: The Soul of Success in the 21st Century</em>, which was released with Hay House’s Balboa Press in September 2011.</p>\n\n<p>With the entrepreneurial itch, Cary left the corporate world in 2001 to start his own firm. His innovative work in design and construction has been featured in print media nationally and on television, including a number of appearances on HGTV and the Fine Living Network. His work was also featured on the hit TV show <em>My Big Amazing Renovation</em>, where he combined four condos into a single luxury home in a notable Chicago high-rise building.  In June 2012, Cary was named as “one of the best and brightest in the design industry” by i4Design Magazine.</p>\n\n<p>Based in Chicago, Cary has worked on design-and-build projects nationwide, including a penthouse in the Four Seasons in Austin, Texas, and a high-end nightclub in Montana.  He also completed the design and renovation of the 7,000 square-foot penthouse in the Trump Tower in Chicago.</p>\n\n<p>For the last 25 years, Cary has studied the secrets of the masters of art, architecture, and energy, including da Vinci, Michelangelo, Vitruvius, Plato, and the ancient Egyptian temple masters.  He has also extensively studied various energy and healing modalities around the country since 1991, including certifications in Polarity Energy work, QiGong, Reconnective Therapy with Herwig Schoen, advanced Pranic Healing with Master Co, and EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique).  In 2009, Cary began his apprenticeship in Native American traditions and shamanism with Hay House author and shaman Peter Calhoun.  With his collective studies in energy and healing modalities, Cary now incorporates the science of energy transformation into his work, creating healing and nurturing environments for clients while establishing a new standard for design and architecture.</p>\n\n<p>In 2015, Cary launched a new brand called <em>Bovéda</em>, bringing the science of energy balancing and harmonization into his proprietary line of jewelry, artwork, and personal care products. He also continues to provide private consultations with individual and corporate clients.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to writing, Cary Weldy speaks at conferences, conducts workshops, and appears as a guest on radio and television programs.  He is currently finishing his next book entitled <em>99 Ways to Harmonize Your Home</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Private sessions with Cary will be available on Sunday and Monday, Jan 15 &amp; 16, 2017.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Private Sessions which will be available are:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Energetic Balancing and Harmonization Consultation</strong>\nEnergy balancing can be done on people, animals (such as pets), objects, or buildings. Some of the masters of art, architecture, and energy, such as da Vinci, Plato, and the ancient Egyptians, knew how direct various qualities of energy into objects or people. As a result, the object would begin resonating with those particular frequencies of energy, and then radiate those energy qualities. By connecting with the appropriate energies, those frequencies can begin working for you in a powerful way. </p>\n\n<p>Using photos of the person, animal, or objects, Energy Designer Cary Weldy measures which energies are needed, and then infuses the image with spiritual symbols and other proprietary methods. During the process, Cary insures that the energy harmonization takes place through careful measurement. By infusing the image, the person(s), pet, or object(s) in the image literally receives those energies.</p>\n\n<p>When you bring blessings to anyone or anything in your life, that power is magnified, and it also increases in time. With a photo that is blessed and then displayed, the energy continues to activate and expand. Therefore, with every client whose photo we bless, we will display your photo at our offices to allow the blessings in your life to increase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Home Protection</strong>\nCurses, negative thought forms, and other toxic energy streams may be piped directly into your home and adversely affecting your health, mood, prosperity, and relationships.

208	Guest Speaker:  Eben Alexander, MD 	NDEr, Neurosurgeon, Author, had amazing Near-Death Experience...Resulting in his presentation on Sacred Acoustics with Karen Newell.   HE WILL BEGIN AT 2 PM.   Don't be late!  (No sharing today.)	Eben Alexander III MD was an academic neurosurgeon for 25\r\nyears, including 15 years at the Brigham & Women’s Hospital, the Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. He dealt with hundreds of patients suffering from alterations in their level of\r\nconsciousness, due to trauma, brain tumors, aneurysms, or strokes. \r\n\r\nDr. Eben Alexander is currently best known as the NY Times best-selling author of *Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife* and *The Map of Heaven: How Science, Religion and Ordinary People are Proving the Afterlife*. His books are available in translation in over 35 countries worldwide. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe thought he had a very good idea of how the brain generates consciousness, mind and spirit. Then, in the predawn hours of Nov. 10, 2008, he became a comatose patient. For\r\nreasons still obscure, he was overcome by bacterial meningitis, rendered\r\ncomatose on a ventilator in the ICU within hours. His physicians were\r\nstunned to find that the culprit was E. coli, which never causes\r\nmeningitis in patients over 3 months of age unless they were infected in\r\na neurosurgical procedure (which he had not been). After 6 days on\r\ntriple antibiotics, showing no response, with little neurological\r\nfunction remaining, his physicians had few words of encouragement for\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nOn day seven, he opened his eyes, to the surprise of all! However, his\r\nearliest recollections were strange and involved no recall of his life\r\nbefore coma. Like a newborn, he had no functioning language, nor\r\nknowledge of this world, our culture, or loved ones surrounding him.\r\n\r\nHis story offers a critical key to the understanding of consciousness, spirituality and human existence.  Memories of his earthly life had been completely deleted inside of the coma, yet he awoke with memories of a fantastic odyssey deep into another realm – more real than this earthly one! The purest and most extraordinary part of his journey happened deep in coma. His entire\r\nneocortex, that outer surface of the brain that makes us human, was\r\ntotally disengaged by the meningitis. How was it possible for that rich\r\nexperience to originate in his brain?\r\n\r\nThe implications are mind-boggling! In analyzing the scientific\r\npossibilities and grand implications, he sees a more complete\r\nreconciliation of modern science and spirituality as a natural product.\r\nHe has been blessed with a complete recovery, and continues to write books \r\nabout the lessons learned and the deepening awareness that began on that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please go to:  www.ebenalexander.com\r\n\r\n[1]: http://www.lifebeyonddeath.net/ \r\n\r\nKaren Newell is co-founder of Sacred Acoustics.  As an innovator in the emerging field of brainwave entrainment audio meditation, Karen Newell empowers others in their own journeys of discovery. Using Sacred Acoustics recordings, she teaches you how to enter and engage your own consciousness in order to connect to inner guidance, achieve inspiration, improve wellness and develop intuition.\r\n\r\nAt international workshops presented with best-selling author Dr. Eben Alexander, Karen demonstrates key practices of consciousness exploration: heart awareness, intention, maintaining neutrality, emotional management and cultivating internal knowing.\r\n\r\nKaren's lifelong passion and interest in historical and ancient cultures, especially sacred sites, led to her unconventional understanding of our present existence. It became clear that in the search for answers to fundamental questions, direct experience is crucial. Karen attended a broad range of hands-on, experiential courses that prepared her to teach others how to connect to their own energetic fields.\r\n\r\nMeditation and heart awareness were central elements to her many different subjects of study. But Karen found it extremely challenging to sit still with focused attention for any length of time. She discovered that the most effective aid for meditation was monotonous sound — not music and singing melodies, but the simple tones produced by crystal bowls, tuning forks, gongs, chimes and human chanting.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to modern methods, Karen found that the regular practice of listening to recordings containing binaural beats minimized distracting thoughts and restlessness, allowing her to finally reach the expanded states of awareness she sought. Karen joined with Kevin Kossi to create original recordings unmatched by any others either of them had experienced. Together, they created Sacred Acoustics.\r\n\r\nDuring 26-years working in the magazine and newspaper publishing field, Karen held key leadership positions involved with the direction and management of technology transitions faced by the print industry.

178	Guest Speaker:  Allan Botkin, PhD	Clinical Psychologist and after-death researcher discusses powerful treatment which releases grief. Author of "Induced After-death Communication: A New Therapy for Healing Grief And Trauma"	For more than twenty-five years Dr. Botkin has been experimenting with\r\nvariations of a new and very powerful psychological procedure called\r\neye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). He discovered that\r\none variation of this procedure results in an experience that nearly all\r\npatients believe is actual communication with the deceased---regardless\r\nof their prior beliefs.\r\n\r\nThis is a new, cutting edge technique in which a near-death-like state\r\nis induced which allows someone who is grieving to meet with the\r\ndeceased on the other side and have an interactive conversation which\r\nheals their grief. This process can take as little as 10 minutes and can\r\nsometimes heal the grief of those who have been in therapy for years. As\r\nof today, Dr Botkin and his colleagues have induced well over 3000 ADCs\r\n(After Death Communications).\r\n\r\nDr. Allan Botkin has been a practicing psychologist since 1983. He\r\nrecently retired from being a clinical psychologist at the VA Medical\r\nCenter in North Chicago, Illinois, where he developed the Intensive\r\nTrauma Program (ITP), which preliminary studies indicate is one of the\r\nmost effective in the country.1 He is now devoting his energy to his\r\nprivate practice in Libertyville, IL, and to speaking on this subject\r\nthroughout the country.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin's expertise in his specialty has long been respected by the\r\npsychotherapeutic community, as indicated by the publication of "Case\r\nstudies of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) with\r\nchronic post-traumatic stress disorder" in the journal,\r\n<i>Psychotherapy, </i>by Lipke and Botkin (1992).

188	Guest Speaker:   Eileen Grace, R.N.	Two NDEs, Hospice Nurse, End of Life Expert, Past-Life and Akashic Reader....	Deeply inspired by people she has served during her 30 years as a hospice nurse, hospice administrator and teacher, Eileen Grace intimately knows the fragility and preciousness of life. She has witnessed and experienced the pain and struggles that change and loss can bring—as well as the tremendous growth and healing that can emerge.\r\n\r\nEileen began her nursing career as an acute care oncology nurse yet was quickly drawn to caring for patients at end of life. As a Hospice Nurse, Eileen specialized in the care of the dying and their families, and was instrumental in developing a home hospice program as well as a 16-bed in-patient hospice home. She has educated healthcare professionals, volunteers, and the community with presentations that include “Compassionate Care of the Dying” and “Conscious Living Practices.” \r\n\r\nIn addition to helping people cross over during the dying process, Eileen has had two near-death experiences. She knows that life is more than what we experience in the physical realm. A healing guide with intuitive listening skills and the wisdom of a greater perspective, Eileen believes that, with support, every person can peel back the pain of confusion, anger, grief, and depression to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and enjoy the amazing results.\r\n\r\nEileen has studied with many profound spiritual teachers and healers. She is a Reiki Master Teacher, Akashic Record Consultant and Certified in Past Life Regression through Dr. Brian Weiss.\r\n \r\nEileen’s Akashic Record Consultation and Spiritual Coaching practice supports individuals in their soul journey.  She helps people see change and loss as opportunities for transformation; a way to bring mind, body, and heart into harmony. Eileen’s Spiritual Mentoring practice supports individuals in their healing journey. Her purpose is to guide people through significant life events—assisting them as they unwrap the gift of difficult circumstances, re-vision their lives, and live from their soul’s true essence.\r\n\r\nEileen has had many articles published on the emotional, spiritual and healing aspects at end of life.\r\n\r\nFor more info, please see:  www.witheileengrace.com	2015-01-10	2014-03-12 21:28:39.060712	2015-01-18 22:44:24.725999	<p>Deeply inspired by people she has served during her 30 years as a hospice nurse, hospice administrator and teacher, Eileen Grace intimately knows the fragility and preciousness of life.

179	Guest Speaker:  Dr Rajiv Parti, MD	NDEr, cardiac anesthesiologist; author; prostate cancer survivor with a miraculous healing....	In 2008 Rajiv Parti, M.D. was a world-class practicing cardiac-anesthesiologist – until his life was ripped apart following a diagnoses of prostate cancer. A routine surgery to treat it instead led to numerous complications. \r\n\r\nBetween 2008 and 2010, Dr. Parti endured chronic pain, dependency on pain medications, depression and seven surgeries, the last of which he nearly did not survive. With a fever of 105 degrees, sepsis, severe pelvic infection and in horrific pain, as he was being prepared for surgery, his consciousness separated from his body.\r\n\r\nWhile on the “other side” Dr. Parti journeyed through several realms of consciousness and beyond the “light at the end of the tunnel”. During his near-death experience, he learned his life’s purpose: to be a healer of the soul, especially diseases of the soul, of the energy body, addiction, depression, chronic pain and cancer. It was only by experiencing the diseases that had befallen him personally that he could truly have empathy for – and help – others, because he now knew how it felt to be in their shoes.\r\n\r\nIn order to help people, Dr. Parti learned that he would have to leave anesthesiology and materialism behind. Miraculously, after learning these things, he returned to his body and, baffling his doctors, experienced a complete recovery from pain, sepsis, addiction and depression. Placing implicit trust and faith in the Divine, Dr. Parti now shares his experience and insights around the world through his writing, coaching and speaking engagements.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nRajiv Parti M.D. is a world-renowned specialist in pain management with over 30 years practicing clinical experience and founder of the Pain Management Institute of California, which, under his direction has served thousands of patients for acute and chronic pain relief.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 Dr. Parti personally encountered the first of a series of health challenges that led him to explore non-traditional evidence based complementary and alternative medicine. His study, exposure and experience in this field has led him to formulate an integrative approach to total wellness, especially pain management, stress and depression: the best and most practical applications of both modern medicine and the medical care charted in the ancient wisdom traditions of India and the East. His discovery of Ayurveda and his subsequent education, training and personal practice of it have given him the rigorous academic and scientific qualification that he was trained to look for as an allopathic doctor.\r\n\r\nDr. Parti has worked with, been in dialogue with and met with some of the world’s most esteemed researchers from Harvard, UCSD, Berkeley, Scripps Integrative in the fields of psychiatry, neuroscience, sleep medicine and pain management who are advocating the use of meditation, yoga and mantra (sound healing), and mandala (color therapy) for modern disorders.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, as a busy practicing cardiac-anesthesiologist and Chief of Anesthesiology at Heart Hospital in Bakersfield, California and enjoying life with his family—everything was turned upside down following a diagnoses of prostate cancer. Enduring seven surgeries and ensuing complications over the next two years, Dr. Parti was gifted with a near death experience that showed him his true purpose in this lifetime.\r\n\r\n“Now it is time to be healer of the soul, especially of the diseases of soul, of the energy body, addiction, depression, chronic pain and cancer.”\r\n\r\nThe awareness that he was being given his life back specifically so that he could write and speak with the specific intent to help others suffering from chronic pain, addiction and depression profoundly changed Dr. Parti’s entire outlook and propelled him to start writing and giving seminars on spiritual wellness.\r\n\r\nIn October 2012, twenty-two months after his visit to the ‘other side', Dr. Parti published his first full-length book on the topic of spiritual healing, "The Soul of Wellness", available on Amazon.com. As well, Dr. Parti has been working with his colleagues at The Pain Management Institute of California researching the effects of meditation and yoga on narcotic requirement for pain management.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Parti’s awareness shifts more and more towards its newly directed purpose, he accepts that he was put back on earth on a Divine path, and that his job is to follow that path faithfully and with trust. Although the future is still being formed, he feels no fear; he knows he is not alone. In his former life, he used to put people to sleep. Now he wakes them up. And he has woken up too.\r\n\r\nAs the full extent of life changes continue to unfold, Dr. Parti has recently joined the ranks of Amazon.com bestselling authors and world-renowned speakers. With four books now available on Amazon.com, he is well on his way to achieving his dream of being a #1 New York Times best selling author and TEDTalk speaker by December 31, 2015, while fulfilling his mission of helping as many people as possible seeking spiritual transformation and healing.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see www.drrajivparti.us	2014-03-08	2013-04-25 21:06:21.348611	2014-03-26 07:04:29.299496	<p>In 2008 Rajiv Parti, M.D. was a world-class practicing cardiac-anesthesiologist – until his life was ripped apart following a diagnoses of prostate cancer.

185	Guest Speaker:  Gregory Shushan, PhD.	University of Oxford, Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion, Research Fellow	Gregory Shushan is a Research Fellow at the Ian Ramsey Centre for Science and Religion, University of Oxford (supported by a grant from the Perrott-Warrick Fund, Trinity College, Cambridge).  He is researching comparative afterlife beliefs in relation to shamanic and near-death experiences in indigenous religions worldwide.  The project follows from his book *Conceptions of the Afterlife in Early Civilizations: Universalism, Constructivism, and Near-Death Experience* (nominated for the 2009 Grawemeyer Award). \r\n\r\nGregory received his PhD in Religious Studies from the University of Wales Lampeter, both his MA in Research Methods for the Humanities and his BA in Egyptian Archaeology from University College London, and his Diploma in Eastern Mediterranean Archaeology from Birkbeck College, University of London.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the issue of the interface of culture, cognition, and ‘religious’ experiences (and attendant implications for relativist/postmodernist extremism), his research interests include concepts of polytheism, syncretism, pluralism, and universalism in cross-cultural contexts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Interests:\r\n\r\nRelationships between religious/mystical experiences and religious beliefs,\r\nCross-cultural comparison,\r\nAncient myth and religion,\r\nAfterlife conceptions,\r\nAncient and indigenous religions,\r\nPluralism and syncretism, and\r\nHistory and theory of religion and myth.\r\n\r\nMy current research examines the relationship between afterlife conceptions and conceptually-related anomalous experiences in ethnohistoric indigenous traditions worldwide. The purpose is to determine the extent to which the conceptions are consistent (a) cross-culturally; (b) with culturally-embedded shamanic ‘other world’ experiences; and (c) with the spontaneous, evidently universal near-death experience (NDE).

189	Guest Speaker: Steven Fanning, PhD	Intense NDE, healing from his broken neck, and the gift of healing ability, changed the life of this UIC History Professor	After a serious accident, Steve Fanning spent two weeks in a coma that left him paralyzed in 1988. Once he returned to consciousness, he was miraculously healed and learned to walk, despite his doctor\\'s prognosis that his walking was neurologically impossible. \r\n\r\nDuring his coma, Steve had a near-death experience through which it was revealed that he had to rearrange his life. From that point on, he began listening to his conscience, ignoring his ego, and started studying mysticism, which resulted in an excellent book: *Mystics of the Christian Tradition* (New York and London: Routledge, 2001). Steve will discuss his NDE and Life Review and focus on the impact that it made upon him.\r\n\r\nNow retired, Steve continues to use the gift of healing which he received during his Near-Death Experience.\r\n\r\nSteve Fanning received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in History from Texas Tech University and his Ph.D. in History from the University of Minnesota. He was Assistant Dean in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, from 1996-1999 and a member of the Department of History there from 1980 until 2012. \r\n\r\nBefore that he was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of History at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the University of Minnesota.

But during a hypnotic regression which he undertook on a bet, he experiences a vivid awareness of being alive in three separate historical scenes.  Remaining skeptical, Snow began to investigate with the intention of disproving reincarnation. \r\n\r\nInstead, diligent research and corroboration from multiple sources reveal solid evidence that he lived a former life as Carroll Beckwith, a nineteenth-century American artist.

201	Guest Speaker:  Susan Dolan, RN, JD	Expert in end of life planning; Author of "The End of Life Advisor", Hospice nurse, lawyer.  Every single one of us needs to hear this message....	Since no one can predict the moment of death and because final days on earth are often spent in diminished awareness, the time to  decide, document and discuss end of life choices is now.  When end of life wishes are discussed and documented in advance, what remains is the business of the heart:  expressing love and gratitude, asking for and offering forgiveness, completing old business, making peace with a higher power and saying good-bye.\r\n\r\nOver the last twenty years, Susan R. Dolan, RN, JD, has guided hundreds of patients and families through a discussion of important life and death issues regarding advance directives, artificial administration of  nutrition and fluids, artificial ventilation, pain management and how to have conversations about end-of-life care, as well as an opportunity to think about and plan how to make your transition an expression of the real you.\r\n\r\nMs. Dolan is a registered nurse, a licensed attorney, a certified mediator and an active healthcare consultant.

216	Guest Speaker:   Debbi Rosales, RN 	NDEr;  Healer, God Conversationalist.  Uplifting stories of direct guidance from God....	When you arrive at Debbi Rosales’ house, you are met by her two rescue Sheltie’s, one of which is missing a patch of fur on one side.   She explains that the dog was diagnosed with an aggressive and incurable cancerous tumor in 2015.  Debbi and her husband, David, in conjunction with God, utilized their healing abilities on her and the tumor disappeared and is now in remission.  Only the still growing hair over the site is indicative of some previous problem. \r\n\r\nWhen she was 6 years old, Debbie Rosales went to heaven as the result of a serious illness.  Since that day, she has been “connected” to God, hearing messages on a regular basis and following instructions to help others improve their lives.  The “God Jobs” as she calls them, are often quite profound and healing and are usually performed for strangers.\r\n\r\nShe is a Holy Fire Reiki Master, and works also with Crystal Bowls, using sound and vibration to heal a multitude of physical, emotional, and spiritual challenges for people.  She is assisted in her work by her husband David, who is also a Reiki Master and her guides, in particular Babaji, who is always with her.\r\n\r\nHearing the call to service early, Debbi became a Registered Nurse for 28 years, including 17 years in the ICU.  In February, 2016, she was told it was time to stop working for the hospital and start working for God.  Since then she has been working her way towards establishing a healing center where her healing gifts can be fully utilized.  She expects to have classes, healing sessions and spiritual retreats with various practitioners in her new center. \r\n\r\nDebbi was born and raised in Joliet, IL, where she received her nursing credentials from  Joliet Junior College and Lewis University.   She raised a family of four children and is now enjoying her six grandchildren while continuing her tutelage in “God Jobs”.  \r\n	2017-05-13	2016-03-09 15:40:34.485447	2017-03-16 21:55:52.632882	<p>When you arrive at Debbi Rosales’ house, you are met by her two rescue Sheltie’s, one of which is missing a patch of fur on one side.

231	Guest Speaker:   Cassandra Bauer	Her NDE, and how it changed her life.   Unwiring the fear, Rewiring with Love.   Founder of Level Up....Engineer of the mind – body – soul, Composer of moments and Writer Cassandra M. Bauer, Founder of LEVEL UP.	Cassandra lost her brother Jason in April of 2013 to a heroin overdose; at the same time battling with her own addictions and unhealthy programing. Alone, struggling, continuously checking out of the game, Cassandra created and manifested a car accident just six months after losing her brother on 11.11.2013 @ 1:11 a.m.\r\n\r\nWaking up alone, confused in that hospital bed , the only thing she was sure of was seeing Jason on the other side .\r\n\r\n”When I woke up in the hospital bed, I was alone. Confused, scared with the only lingering recollection being seeing Jason on the other side telling me, ‘You are not alone Cass, I am here. But you need to go back. You are to create a channel to allow everyone to know they ARE NOT ALONE. Please remember you are not alone.’ There was never a moment inside of me where I didn’t believe in this. I knew I had seen him , clear as day , he was in the same hospital gown, the one I had said goodbye to him in before his funeral. I knew I had felt him, I knew my truth in that moment. I knew IT WAS MY moment.\r\n\r\nFor months prior I would drive to work and create countless illusions around myself being in a hospital bed. All the love that would show up for me… all the people that would come and ’finally ’ care about me. The hours I spent channeling this illusion was the energy in which created my now reality. The reality I was now awake with. The reality of: WE COME IN THIS WORLD ALONE AND WE GO OUT OF IT ALONE. BUT IT ’S ABOUT WHO WILL YOU BECOME WHILE YOU ARE HERE? THAT ’S A FUCKING REALITY CHECK POINT I NEEDED TO SIT WITH. Am I going to go back to the life I was living? The one that was obviously no longer serving me? Was I going to continue to numb out of the game? Or was I finally ready to make the proper steps to powerfully checking back into the game?\r\n\r\nI sat in that hospital bed for days, hours, seconds MOMENTS. And I made a decision in those moments. I AM LOVE. I WILL WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO BECOME A DEEPER AND DEEPER FORM OF LOVE. ONE THAT WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH IT YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE TO FIND THAT POINT WITHIN YOURSELF THAT MAYBE YOU FORGOT ABOUT OR RAN FROM OUT OF FEAR AND ALLOW THAT TO FLOW AGAIN. NO CHOICE BUT TO REMEMBER THAT LOVE THAT WE ALL HAVE. OUR BIRTH PLACE… OUR HOME… I was to become the perfect mirror. I was to become the warrior within each and every one of us, the one within my brother to fight for these wings. To fight for the real peace, the one within. From that moment on I have never been alone. I had finally found myself. I HAD FINALLY LEVELED UP. ” – Cassandra M. Bauer    \r\n\r\nAfter years of intense isolation unwiring her own fear and rewiring with her deepest form of love, Cassandra found and channeled her company LEVEL UP.\r\n\r\nLEVEL UP is a movement for RADICAL FREEDOM, it has become a HOME for angels to find their wings to FLY again or lay their wings down and know it is always OKAY to just BE. LEVEL UP is here as a social movement, a daily conscious intention, a way of life and a conscious commitment to SELF.\r\n\r\nAlong the journey of creating her OWN fairy-tale she is in the process of writing THE LEVEL UP METHOD. A guide on how to Unwire the Fear. Rewire with Love. A deep exploration on how to uncover your personal legend and live into your moments to create your ultimate fairy-tale.\r\n\r\nLEVEL UP is a mirror of living a life where YOU get to create your story to uncover the TRUTH of why YOU chose this TIME, THIS REALM AND THIS DIMENSION.\r\n\r\n86,400 Moments in a day. How many MOMENTS are you checking into the game? Consciously showing up for? Consciously choosing into?\r\n\r\nHow many MOMENTS go by where you feel Unheard? Unseen? Or Misunderstood? OR HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOU EVEN ARE?\r\n\r\nThe truth is most of us stop listening to ourselves and stop truly seeing ourselves for the beautiful creations that WE ARE.\r\n\r\nFrom years of compromising our truest wants, needs, and desires we HIT THE WALL and learn to silence our voice, and not look directly in the mirror. We begin to numb by daily distractions, old wires, stagnant energy, substance abuse or relationships that no longer serve us.\r\n\r\nThrough years of abuse, pain and suffering which led to her death, Cassandra understands the depth of what it feels like to flow through this world lost, numb and invisible. The struggle of wanting to check back into this game. What it is like to HIT THE WALL , LITERALLY and metaphorically.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself a question in this moment: Are you ready to see yourself? Are you ready to hear yourself? To REPROGRAM yourself? To FREE YOURSELF?\r\n\r\n“TO UNDERSTAND IS TO BE FREE ”-Baruch Spinoza\r\n\r\n–Cassandra Mary Bauer, Founder, I am LEVEL UP\r\n\r\nLearn More About Cassandra M.

203	Guest Speaker:  Julie Payne	Healing with advanced radionics devices....how does it work?  She is a stunning healer and will give a demonstration with the CoRe (Co-Resonance) machine...	Julie Ann Payne, CHT, CoRe, received her own healing miracle after an intense five-year struggle with Lyme Disease which completely disabled her, and which motivated her to dedicate the rest of her life to bringing the world’s powerful spiritual tools to people desiring reconnection with their own Divinity.   \r\n\r\nShe developed and created Cell Integrity Sessions, utilizing a very advanced radionics device, CoRe (Co-Resonance), invented by Austria’s Scientist/Physicist Kiran Schmidt.   \r\n\r\nA Cell Integrity Session can read imbalances within the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual etheric bodies.   The 100 trillion cells which make up one’s body include transmitter and receptor sites continually recording its life experiences.  Julie is able to use her intuitive skills, along with the CoRe system to observe one’s energetic intelligence system through his/her cellular expressions.\r\n\r\nShe has served as a CoRe practitioner and spiritual coach for 10 years in her Southern California private practice and where she is also part of a group program called GPS:  Gifts to Project Your Soul, which uses psychotherapy, pranic healing, and Cell Integrity Sessions.  Her colleagues in that endeavor are Carol Cole, Clinical Social Worker/Therapist and Dennis Markowitz, Pranic Healer.\r\n\r\nHer curiosity about the mysterious, along with the bittersweet elements of being an empath, keep Julie searching for the knowledge of her true Divine self.  She is also the mother of three grown children.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see www.nhr4cis.\r\n\r\n>A limited number of private one-on-one 55 min healing sessions ($100) will be available for three days following Ms. Payne's presentation.  Watch for an email announcement of this offering. \r\n\r\n>During the session you will be given a brief analysis with CoRe.

The 100 trillion cells which make up one’s body include transmitter and receptor sites continually recording its life experiences.  Julie is able to use her intuitive skills, along with the CoRe system to observe one’s energetic intelligence system through his/her cellular expressions.</p>\n\n<p>She has served as a CoRe practitioner and spiritual coach for 10 years in her Southern California private practice and where she is also part of a group program called GPS:  Gifts to Project Your Soul, which uses psychotherapy, pranic healing, and Cell Integrity Sessions.  Her colleagues in that endeavor are Carol Cole, Clinical Social Worker/Therapist and Dennis Markowitz, Pranic Healer.</p>\n\n<p>Her curiosity about the mysterious, along with the bittersweet elements of being an empath, keep Julie searching for the knowledge of her true Divine self.  She is also the mother of three grown children.</p>\n\n<p>For more info, see <a href="http://www.nhr4cis">www.nhr4cis</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A limited number of private one-on-one 55 min healing sessions ($100) will be available for three days following Ms. Payne&rsquo;s presentation.

206	Guest Speaker:   Joanne Koenig-Macko	3 NDEs; Internationally known spiritual artist, coach, author, lecturer and teacher.	\r\n\r\n\r\nJoanne Koenig-Macko is an internationally known artist, spiritual coach, author, and dynamic lecturer. Three intense near-death experiences changed her life forever. Joanne was shown many things to help humanity move forward, and as her guides spoke with her, she learned countless life lessons and why we experience them here in the “Earth School”.\r\n\r\nMedical school seemed a logical choice, but after studying at Case Western Reserve medical school for a while, Joanne realized that was not her path.  She studied energy healing with many masters around the world and became passionate about balancing the body through natural supplements and/or nutraceuticals of the highest vibration. She is certified as a Reiki Master and in many other modalities, including all aspects of Theta Healing.  She works intuitively to see what is not working in the human body using the four-fold philosophy. For over twenty years, clients have come to her from around the globe.  \r\n\r\nShe has worked with over 6,000 clients using her Angel Therapy sessions, sketching what she sees around the client during the session. She currently has reps in Japan and thousands of clients who not only collect her inspirational art but also consult her for spiritual energy healing. \r\n\r\nHer ethereal visionary art has been presented to countless world leaders and she has served as Director of *International Angels for World Peace* under the umbrella of the *World Citizen Diplomats*.  She is listed in “Who’s Who” of women in business.  Madeleine Albright  wrote a personal note to her after  hanging Joanne's  “World Peace Angel” outside her office for all visitors to see.\r\n\r\nFor the last twelve years, Joanne has produced the annual *Lightworker’s Conference*.   Her passion for producing this high-energy, wisdom-filled conference stems from her 22 years of expertise in the corporate world, which she left behind to pursue her mission of helping to raise the world’s mass consciousness. She is currently writing a book about all she’s learned from her clients, her guides, and her amazing life experiences.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see www.joannemacko,com.\r\n	2016-07-09	2015-11-02 18:03:35.241496	2016-09-04 20:15:49.806135	<p>Joanne Koenig-Macko is an internationally known artist, spiritual coach, author, and dynamic lecturer.

207	Guest Speaker:   Debra Diamond	NDEr, Psychic, Medium, Medical Intuitive, Author of "Life After Near Death:  Miraculous Stories of Healing and Transformation in the Extraordinary Lives of People with Newfound Powers."	Debra Diamond is a former Wall Street money manager and artist who left a high-profile life to pursue one of purpose and spirituality. In 2008, she had a transformational experience that left her with unconventional powers as a clairvoyant and medium. \r\n\r\nAs an investment professional, Debra was a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a regular commentator on CNBC. She was profiled in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, the Washington Post, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Baltimore Sun. She has an MBA from George Washington University and is a graduate of Christie’s Education and the Jung Institute. \r\nThe mother of three sons, Debra splits her time between Taos, New Mexico, and the East Coast.\r\n\r\nHer book, *Life After Near Death,* profiles a dozen cases of near-death experience after-effects, including newfound musical and artistic talents, mathematical gifts, enhanced hearing, elevated IQ, improved vision, spontaneous healing, and electrical sensitivity. Bridging the gap between science and spirituality, \r\n\r\n*Life After Near Death* explores these miraculous after-effects and new evidence concerning the NDE to reveal for the first time:\r\n\r\n\r\n*    New evidence affirming the survival of consciousness after death.\r\n*    The circumstances and conditions that give rise to a NDE.\r\n*    The link between predisposition and the NDE.\r\n*    The role of manifestation and intent and the NDE.\r\n*    The unmistakable connections between the energetic world and the NDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Life After Near Death* is the only book to explore the deeper meaning of the near-death experience through the prism of its extraordinary after-effects. It offers a new, science-based paradigm to unravel the NDE and our assumptions regarding the afterlife. Because although you can return from an NDE, you will never return to your former life.\r\n\r\nDebra Diamond is a natural psychic, medium  and medical intuitive who was gifted with her abilities as a child.  She offers psychic and mediumship readings, energy and chakra healing, guidance for  metaphysical, physical and emotional issues as well as workshops and classes.

My training prepared me to help care for the very sick, but it did not prepare me for encounters with the unknown. Over the past twenty years I've heard numerous mysterious and beautiful stories that patients have returned from the brink of death to share with me. They are both incredible and life-affirming. \r\n​\r\nSeveral years ago I began journaling about these miraculous moments. When one of these stories was published, I was excited and inspired by the response and knew I had to write a book about it. \r\n \r\n*Near Death in the ICU* is that book and, I am happy to announce it has now been published and is available on Amazon. Within two days of its release, it became a #1-best-seller in three catagories and now is four-time award winner.

223	Guest Speaker:  Joyce Hawkes, PhD	NDEr, Healer, Cell Biologist, Author of "Cell Level Healing" and "Resonance: Nine Practices for Harmonious Health and Vitality.",  from Seattle....	A passionate and productive scientist, student, mystic, teacher and\r\nhealer, Dr Joyce Hawkes is internationally recognized for her work as a\r\nresearch scientist and her more recent work as a teacher of Cell-Level\r\nhealing. \r\n\r\nHer early work on the biophysics of cell structure and function\r\nincluded a position as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National\r\nInstitutes of Health. She published nearly 50 papers, abstracts, and\r\nbook chapters. The innovative excellence of her research earned her\r\nelection to the position of Fellow in the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, a position which she maintains presently.\r\n\r\nIn 1984, following a Near-Death Experience, she changed careers and\r\nembarked on an extensive exploration of spiritual and healing\r\ntraditions. Recognized on first sight by her indigenous teachers as\r\nauthentically and exceptionally gifted, she was invited into the native cultures of healing wisdom by those who had not previously taken Western students. \r\n\r\nNearly three months living in the Philippines and work with a\r\nnative healer preceded her exploration of additional SE Asian healing\r\npractices. A month long stay in South India and six trips to Bali to\r\nwork intensively with two native Hindu priest/shamans immersed her in\r\nEastern philosophy, remote village life, and first-hand experience of\r\nnumerous practical applications of indigenous healing modalities.\r\n\r\nWith thirty two years experience working as a spiritual counselor,\r\nhealer, and seminar leader across the USA and abroad,\r\nJoyce combines her rigorous background as a scientist and her compassion as a healer in her presentations and writing. \r\n\r\nHer book: *Cell-Level Healing. The Bridge from Soul to Cell (Oct 2006)* demonstrates effective ways to harmonize spirituality and  Western science. A popular seminar leader and conference presenter, she has also appeared on radio: Coast to Coast in the US and Canada; on local, national, and international TV; and at major global   conferences to speak about her insights and successful applications of Cell-Level healing for optimal health.  \r\n\r\nHer second book *Resonance: Nine Practices for Harmonious Health and Vitality* explores the uncharted interfaces between science and spirit in relation to health and well-being.  \r\n\r\nReviews of Joyce's book: *Cell-Level Healing. The Bridge from Soul\r\nto Cell (Oct 2006)*\r\n\r\n"*Cell-Level Healing* is a remarkable bridge between conventional cell\r\nbiology and the far reaches of self and spiritual healing. Dr. Hawkes\r\nskillfully combines her solid scientific grounding and experience in\r\nmainstream biophysics with personal insights gained from a near death\r\nexperience and extensive training in the alternative healing arts.\r\nHawkes beautifully demonstrates how science and spirituality can\r\npeacefully coexist and inform each other in beneficial and refreshing\r\nways.” —Dean Radin PhD, Senior Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences\r\n\r\n“*Cell-Level Healing* is quite simply the whole exciting truth about how\r\nand why our consciousness is key to our physical health and well-being.”\r\n—Christiane Northrup, M. D., author of *Mother-Daughter Wisdom*, *The\r\nWisdom of Menopause*, and *Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom*\r\n\r\n“A remarkable book. *Cell-Level Healing* provides the reader with a poetic\r\nand visual text on self-healing and demonstrates how science and\r\nspirituality need not be opponents but can serve as allies in the\r\nreader’s transformation. Dr. Joyce Hawkes has created a delightful\r\nuser-friendly volume that can be read, savored, and re-read—one that is\r\nboth simple and profound.” —Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Saybrook Graduate\r\nSchool and Research Center; co-editor of Varieties of Anomalous\r\nExperience; and author of *Extraordinary Dreams and How to Work with Them*\r\n\r\n“Science and spirit are brought together with beauty and discernment in\r\nthis exquisite book. Joyce Hawkes offers us a vision of healing that\r\ntruly manages to bridge worlds which only remain separate at our peril.\r\n‘The Bridge from Soul to Cell’ is more than a good metaphor: it links\r\nwisdom and science and by doing so opens the way for great healing.”\r\n—James O’Dea, president, Institute of Noetic Sciences\r\n\r\n“Joyce Hawkes blends and makes whole our splintered perceptions of the\r\nroles of science and spirit in healing. Her beautiful vision of how\r\ncells house the very power of the universe, speaks to a greater\r\nunderstanding and the interconnectedness of the spiritual in the\r\nphysical. In this broader understanding, Joyce bridges the gulf between\r\nthe tangible and the intangible. She offers up the potential for\r\nself-healing, always waiting within us. Her book is both art and science\r\nfor healing” —Joan C. King, Ph. D., professor emerita at Tufts\r\nUniversity School of Medicine, author of the Cellular Wisdom series\r\n\r\n“The intrinsic nature of our being is primordially pure, luminous\r\nawareness—and mind and body are the unified expression of that reality.\r\nDr. Hawkes’s insightful work brings a depth of scientific knowledge\r\ntogether with the tools for applying that understanding in a way that\r\nrelieves suffering and promotes spiritual awareness. Cell-Level Healing\r\nsheds welcome light on the interdependence of our inner and outer\r\nworlds. It provides practical guidance for working with the challenges\r\nof illness while supporting our journey of personal transformation.\r\n—Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, founder and president of Nalandabodhi and\r\nNitartha International, author of *Wild Awakening: The Heart of Mahamudra\r\nand Dzogchen*\r\n\r\nFor more info, visit her web site: http://www.celllevelhealing.com 	2017-11-11	2016-12-02 06:03:54.191824	2017-03-18 05:44:22.662504	<p>A passionate and productive scientist, student, mystic, teacher and\nhealer, Dr Joyce Hawkes is internationally recognized for her work as a\nresearch scientist and her more recent work as a teacher of Cell-Level\nhealing. </p>\n\n<p>Her early work on the biophysics of cell structure and function\nincluded a position as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National\nInstitutes of Health.

213	Guest Speaker:   Elizabeth Romo	 Evidential Medium, Intuitive, Spiritual Teacher and Angel Consultant	*Sent by God, angels are a source of support and assistance to humanity.  They bring Divine energy to us, if we accept it.*   \r\n\r\n*Elizabeth will discuss how she came to know and work closely with the energy and purpose of angels, and how we can connect and accept these angelic gifts.* \r\n\r\n*During this presentation, Elizabeth will also facilitate A GUIDED HEALING MEDITATION WITH THE ANGELIC REALM which will offer healing and peace of heart and mind to all.*\r\n\r\nElizabeth Romo (O.M.C., Cht., L.B.L.) was born intuitive and empathic. In 1993 she had an intuitive reading which culminated in a personal message to Elizabeth from the angels that said "It's time to do your work," which motivated her to really get going and take her gifts seriously. She has been counseling a nation-wide portfolio of clients since then. \r\n\r\nElizabeth shares that the intention of her business, *A Haven For Angels,* is to help individuals become aware of the many ways angels touch their lives, and that angelic inspiration, information and actions can bring key solutions and transformation to one's life.

224	Guest Speaker: Yvonne Kason, MD	 4 NDEs, Author, A dramatic near-death experience changed Yvonne Kason's life forever and prompted her study of the mystical experiences that fall beyond the everyday, from Toronto.  \r\n   THIS LECTURE WILL BEGIN AT 2 PM!\r\n\r\n	Dr. Yvonne Kason is a medical doctor who has had 4 Near-Death Experiences and who has 38 years experience researching and counseling persons who had Near-Death and other Spiritually Transformative Experiences (STEs).   STEs include NDEs, Mystical Experiences, Kundalini Awakening,  Psychic Experiences, and Inspired Creativity.  \r\n\r\nShe is the person who first coined the phrase “Spiritually Transformative Experiences“ in 1994,  to describe how the love and light of NDEs and other STEs tend to transform the experiencer, changing them in a more spiritual direction.  She describes her NDE in a 1979 plane crash, and her subsequent research into STEs and their profound long-term after-effects in her inspiring and educational book *Farther Shores*.\r\n\r\nHer talk is entitled:  **Exploring Spiritually Transformative Experiences:  How Near-Death, Kundalini, and Mystical Experiences Changed my Life, and Transform Other Experiencers’ Lives!**  \r\n This is very important information for all experiencers, their counselors, and their families.\r\n\r\nUsing the model of “Purifying the Heart”, Dr. Kason will outline the 5 progressive spiritual stages that STE experiencers grow through after their spiritual awakening and as after-effects of STEs.  This beautiful model is based on Dr. Kason’s many years of clinical experience researching and counseling STErs, and the model as described by Swami Sri Yukteswar in *The Holy Science*.  \r\n\r\nDr. Kason will share the dramatic stories of her own 4 Near-Death Experiences and kundalini awakening as  case examples, to show how the loving light of NDEs and other STEs can propel experiencers forward onto their next spiritual  life-stage. The changing psychological and spiritual focus in the 5 stages  will be outlined so that this model can be used as a roadmap by STErs and their counselors alike.\r\n\r\nDr. Yvonne Kason BSc, MD, MEd, CCFP, FCFP, is an internationally renowned medical expert on Near-Death Experiences, Kundalini, and Spiritually Transformative Experiences.  A pioneer in the field of Spirituality in Health Care, she co-founded the Spirituality in Health Care Network in 2000, and chaired the University of Toronto’s first international conference on Spirituality and Health Care in 2002.  She founded the Spiritual Emergence Research and Referral Clinic in 1992, and was a co-founder of the Kundalini Research Network in 1990.\r\n\r\nDr. Yvonne Kason MD is a family physician and Transpersonal Psychotherapist, currently retired. She was an assistant professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, and on staff at three Toronto teaching hospitals. She was the first Canadian medical doctor to specialize her practice on the research and counseling patients of who had Near-Death Experiences,  and other Spiritually Transformative Experiences. She is the author of four books, and has more than 20 published articles.\r\n\r\nDr. Kason retired from medical practice after a Traumatic Brain Injury in November 2003.  Following a spontaneous brain healing in February 2016, a miracle of neuroplasticity, Dr. Kason has now resumed writing and making professional and media presentations regarding her extensive personal and professional experience with NDEs and STEs.\r\n\r\nDr. Kason is a mother and devoted long time practitioner of yoga meditation.  She speaks three languages, English, German, and French, and divides her time between living in Toronto, Canada, and Encinitas, California.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Yvonne Kason's book:  *Farther Shores*:\r\n\r\nA dramatic near-death experience during a frightening airplane crash in an arctic blizzard changed Yvonne Kason’s life forever and prompted her study of the mystical experiences that fall beyond the everyday. In *Farther Shores*, Dr. Kason shares the story of her NDE, and explores a wide range of Spiritually Transformative Experiences – Near-Death Experiences, mystical experiences, spiritual energy/kundalini episodes, psychic awakenings and spontaneous inspired creativity – by sharing fascinating real-life stories.\r\n\r\n*Farther Shores* is an inspiring book for those who have experiences beyond the extraordinary and for the health care professionals to whom they turn for help. Dr. Kason offers sound advice on how to use these occurrences for spiritual growth and personal healing.\r\n\r\n“…an exceptional book…[that] takes the reader into a world where mystical happenings bring direction and healing to our everyday lives.” – Jyoti (Jeneane Prevatt, Ph.D.) \r\nFormer Director of the Spiritual Emergence Network, \r\nAuthor of *An Angel Called My Name*\r\n\r\n“… a major contribution to our understanding of a wide range of spiritually transformative experiences….  Kason is a wise and knowledgeable guide in these realms, and I can recommend her book with the greatest enthusiasm.” – Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. \r\nProfessor Emeritus of Psychology, University of Connecticut,\r\nAuthor of *Healing Toward Omega* and *Lessons from the Light*\r\n\r\n“…builds a bridge between the scientific and the spiritual, a bridge physicians will feel comfortable crossing.” – *Family Practice*\r\n\r\n	2017-12-09	2016-12-02 06:04:42.066277	2017-08-20 16:46:48.77062	<p>Dr. Yvonne Kason is a medical doctor who has had 4 Near-Death Experiences and who has 38 years experience researching and counseling persons who had Near-Death and other Spiritually Transformative Experiences (STEs).

214	Guest Speaker:  Terry Ashby Larkin	NDEr; Author of "The Light Gap:  God's Amazing Presence."	In 1982 Terry died in a car accident. She was pronounced dead, but she survived. Terry found herself looking down at her body in the center of a frantic scene at the hospital. She was drawn into luminescent, white light, full of pure love. Her Inner Divine Spirit awakened with her Near-Death Experience message of pure love, filled with amazing healing potential.\r\n\r\nAt first, Terry feared being misunderstood. Only her friends and family knew. She spent years researching the connection between the human brain, science, spirituality and the ability to heal ourselves. In 2006 when serious health problems plagued Terry, she started to revisit what she learned from her long buried NDE. She knew a life full of countless medications and sickness was not why she came back from death.\r\n\r\nTerry is now healthy, drug free, and committed to sharing the wisdom she has acquired to help others find love, peace, and healing amidst the difficult times in their own lives.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2015, Terry received the West Michigan Character Council award for Boldness, boosting her confidence to keep writing and sharing her experiences. She helps us understand that pure love emanating from the heart sends healing messages to our bodies as well as to the universe. Our world desperately needs all of us sending pure messages of love, compassion, and peace.\r\n\r\nTerry has been living in Holland, MI, for 29 years with her husband Doug. She taught in the Holland Public Schools for 24 years before retiring. During these years she spent 10 years leading environmental excursions for middle and high school students from across the country into the Amazon Basin in Peru, hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, Costa Rica, and Kenya.  Terry and Doug also lived for a short time in Tennessee, Colorado and Germany.  They now have three grown sons and four delightful grandchildren.\r\n\r\nHer book, *The Light Gap*, was written with her sister, Marjorie Steiner, from Northbrook, IL.  Marjorie lost her 19 year old daughter in London in 1996.  Their respective Light experiences brought them together to reach out to others to help them understand that we do not die, and death is nothing to fear.\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more information, visit www.thelightgap.com	2017-03-11	2016-01-19 01:58:04.607636	2017-03-02 19:18:53.010021	<p>In 1982 Terry died in a car accident.

221	Guest Speaker:  Daniel Drasin	Award winning documentary Film-maker, Photographer, and Expert in Electronic Voice Communication with the Departed. FILM WILL BEGIN AT 2 PM!	Daniel Drasin was born and raised in the New York City area and now resides near San Francisco. His interests are broadly scattered throughout the arts, sciences and humanities. Following a brief, five-semester run-in with higher education at Pratt Institute, Harvard University, and the New School, he began a career in independent filmmaking and media production that has now spanned over five decades—including a 44-year affiliation with New Dimensions Radio. Parallel to Dan's professional life has been an abiding interest in paranormal phenomena and anomalous experiences, initiated by numerous precognitive dreams during his childhood. Dan eventually became an avid investigator of the UFO phenomenon and later developed an abiding interest in various facets of afterlife research. Since the passing of his former partner Jane in 2007, Dan has received a number of unmistakable communications from her.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, September 7, at 7 pm at the Wilmette Theater, Dan Drasin will show a 85 min. documentary film he co-produced about the *Scole Experiment*, widely recognized as the longest-running, most successful experiment in afterlife communication ever conducted.  After the movie, he will continue with a conversation on the subject with Jenniffer Weigel.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, September 9, at our regular Chicago IANDS meeting at Evanston Hospital, Dan will show his 95-minute documentary, *Calling Earth*, which probes the puzzling phenomenon of Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC)— apparent messages from the other side received through modern electronic and photographic devices. ITC has been well documented by researchers at least as far back as the 1950s when tape recorders first became available to the general public and unexplained voices began to show up in people’s recordings.

His interests are broadly scattered throughout the arts, sciences and humanities. Following a brief, five-semester run-in with higher education at Pratt Institute, Harvard University, and the New School, he began a career in independent filmmaking and media production that has now spanned over five decades—including a 44-year affiliation with New Dimensions Radio. Parallel to Dan&rsquo;s professional life has been an abiding interest in paranormal phenomena and anomalous experiences, initiated by numerous precognitive dreams during his childhood. Dan eventually became an avid investigator of the UFO phenomenon and later developed an abiding interest in various facets of afterlife research. Since the passing of his former partner Jane in 2007, Dan has received a number of unmistakable communications from her.</p>\n\n<p>On Thursday, September 7, at 7 pm at the Wilmette Theater, Dan Drasin will show a 85 min. documentary film he co-produced about the <em>Scole Experiment</em>, widely recognized as the longest-running, most successful experiment in afterlife communication ever conducted.  After the movie, he will continue with a conversation on the subject with Jenniffer Weigel.</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday, September 9, at our regular Chicago IANDS meeting at Evanston Hospital, Dan will show his 95-minute documentary, <em>Calling Earth</em>, which probes the puzzling phenomenon of Instrumental Transcommunication (ITC)— apparent messages from the other side received through modern electronic and photographic devices. ITC has been well documented by researchers at least as far back as the 1950s when tape recorders first became available to the general public and unexplained voices began to show up in people’s recordings. The film provides do-it-yourself instructions for those who would like to experiment with this approach to contacting the departed.  Following the break Dan will speak about his personal odyssey and will be pleased to answer any questions about his life and work.</p>\n\n<p>Dan writes: “The notion of other dimensions of existence, including an afterlife…makes no sense from the perspective of modern materialism, just as the notion of a solar system made no sense in Medieval Times, when the Earth appeared to be the enter of things.

229	Guest Speaker:  Robin Landsong	Multiple NDEs, abducted at age 8, taken to Rhodesia, shot and began to die of blood loss, toured the other side, now a sound healer....CHICAGO IANDS 20th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION!!	Robin Landsong is a Visual Artist, Medicine Singer, Craniosacral Therapist, and Health Intuitive. She has had multiple Near Death Experiences which opened her creativity, and ability to see into the health of others. She has given over 10,000 healing sessions both in person and Distance treatments. She and her husband, John Utter, also offer Singing Medicine Circles. ​\r\n\r\nWhen she was eight years old, in 1977, she was abducted by an American from the US and taken to Africa. They landed in Rhodesia during the Bush War. She was later abandoned out in the countryside and spent the night alone. In the morning she made her way to a village where they took her in. They became her new family. She learned how to sing their songs, how to prepare their food, and she participated in their ceremonies. One woman adopted her and became her Mama. \r\n\r\nWeeks later, she was shot by soldiers and crossed over into death. On the other side she met five beings who led her through her confusion and pain to acceptance and peace. In a state of pure love she looked back and saw her Mama wailing while holding her body. Though she treasured her, she resumed crossing through veils toward the Great Heart. She then began to hear a song that made her pause. Her Mama was singing her Medicine Song over Robin's lifeless body. She heard her through the veils. Her song reminded Robin that she was also a medicine singer and that she needed to live to fulfill this purpose. \r\n\r\n**This is a fragrance-free event, please do not wear perfume, cologne, or artificially scented personal products.** We appreciate your help in making this a safe environment for everyone. \r\n\r\nIn particular **Robin is allergic to Tide laundry detergent**.

225	Guest Speaker:   Eric Pearl	NDEr, Healer, Author of "The Reconnection"	Dr. Eric Pearl ran a chiropractic practice in Los Angeles before discovering Reconnective Healing. One day, his patients began to report healings when he simply held his hands near them, without him physically touching them. So, he went in search of the universal wisdom behind what was happening. Unlike today’s known forms of Energy Healing, this work can be practiced without complex technique or elaborate ritual. Through Dr. Pearl’s journey of research and discovery, it became clear that the appropriate name for this work is “Reconnective Healing.”\r\n\r\nNow recognized and supported by science, Reconnective Healing facilitates healings for people that are often instantaneous and can last a lifetime. Feeling compelled to teach others, Eric’s work has taken him to over 100 countries and has affected millions of people. Eric’s hope is that one day everyone will learn to access this natural ability and will use it to heal themselves and others.\r\n\r\nDr. Eric Pearl has been featured in top media including The Dr. Oz Show, The New York Times and CNN.

235	Guest Speaker:  Dr. Christopher Kerr	Hospice Doctor, Buffalo, NY,  Wonderful end-of-life messages....	Christopher Kerr, MD, PhD, is a Hospice and Palliative Care physician who serves as the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Medical Officer at The Center for Hospice & Palliative Care in Buffalo, NY, where he has worked since 1999. \r\n\r\nDr. Kerr was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, and comes from a long line of physicians, of which he is now the fifth generation. Dr. Kerr has an undergraduate degree in Psychology, a Doctorate of Medicine, a PhD in Neurobiology, and he completed his residency in Internal Medicine at the University of Rochester. Dr. Kerr received numerous awards throughout training that recognized his clinical performance as well as his success as an educator and scientist. \r\n\r\nOutside of direct patient care, Dr. Kerr’s focus is in the areas of leadership and advocacy. His passion is palliative care and a belief that such care should be offered upstream of its origins in hospice and throughout the continuum of illness. The core principles of palliative care are patient/family centered care that is directed at optimizing ones quality of life by anticipating, preventing and treating suffering. This involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual needs and facilitating patient autonomy, access to information, and choice. Dr. Kerr has overseen the integration and expansion of palliative care into local hospitals and developed one of the nation’s largest home based palliative care programs, which includes services for children. He has lectured and published on innovative program models that are designed to better align patient/family services to the complexity of needs inherent to advanced illness. Under Dr. Kerr’s medical leadership, Hospice Buffalo now serves 1,000 patients a day, half of whom receive services prior to hospice.\r\n\r\nDr. Kerr’s background in research has evolved from bench science towards the human experience of illness as witnessed from the bedside, specifically patient’s dreams and visions at the end of life. Although medically ignored, these near universal experiences often provide comfort and meaning, as well as insight into the life led and the death anticipated. To date, the research team at Hospice Buffalo has published multiple studies on this topic and documented over 1,200 end-of-life events, many of which are videotaped. This work was the subject of his TEDx Buffalo Talk which has been viewed approximately a million times. It has been the subject of reports on the BBC, in The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, Scientific American Mind, Huffington Post, and Psychology Today, and is the subject of a documentary film in development. It has also gathered international attention and been reported in multiple countries including Norway, Korea, Ireland, India, and China.  Dr. Kerr’s work is also being published by Penguin Random House in 2020.\r\n\r\nDr. Kerr has a lifelong love of horses and runs a 30-acre working horse farm in East Aurora, NY which is home to as many as 20 horses. His farm also serves as the site for a Somalian immigrant farming project, for which fallow land was recovered to cultivate large scale community gardens. The goal has been to help these newcomers, now living in Buffalo’s inner-city, reconnect with their traditional farming practices and feed their families. Dr. Kerr is also board chairman of Lothlorien, the oldest therapeutic riding center in the country, which serves individuals with disabilities as well as those without disability but who may benefit from connecting with horses, such as inner city children and veterans. He has two daughters, Bobbie who helps with the horses, and Maddie who oversees the care of the pigs and goats. \r\n\r\nView Dr. Kerr's Ted talk: *I See Dead People:  Dreams and Visions of the Dying*, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbnBe-vXGQM]\r\n	2018-10-13	2017-11-25 18:40:10.001531	2018-09-01 22:19:37.52717	<p>Christopher Kerr, MD, PhD, is a Hospice and Palliative Care physician who serves as the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Medical Officer at The Center for Hospice &amp; Palliative Care in Buffalo, NY, where he has worked since 1999. </p>\n\n<p>Dr. Kerr was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, and comes from a long line of physicians, of which he is now the fifth generation.

241	Guest Speaker:  Jane DeForest	NDEr, Psychic Medium, Artist, Author, Leader of Portland IANDS	 \r\nArtist. Intuitive. Author. Animal Communicator. With her intuitive art technique, Jane often draws exact renderings, and translates meaningful messages from people & animals who are in the Afterlife. \r\n\r\nJane has done intuitive sessions with personal, animal and business clients for 20 years. In her sessions, and “Message From Beyond” gallery readings, Jane accesses factual information about people & places at distant locations (and times), called “remote viewing”.\r\n\r\nAs a professional artist, Jane has painted murals and\r\npersonal canvases and her artwork is in collections all over the world, including in homes of Martin Sheen & Jane Goodall.\r\n\r\nAs an author, Jane’s richly illustrated book (co-illustrator Tara de Forest): *Love Never Dies-A Psychic Artist Illustrates True Stories Of The\r\nAfterlife*, has been well received and recognized with three awards. \r\n\r\nJane studied at Rhode Island School of Design and with Lakota\r\nShaman, with Buddhist teachers, master psychic Louise Hauck and has journeyed to sacred sites in Peru, Bali, and Egypt.\r\n\r\nHer current Workshops include: “I Knew You Were Going To Say That-The Science Of Practical Intuition,” “Nurturing Intuition-A Workshop For Kids & Their Grown-Ups,” “Messages From Beyond-Afterlife Communication” and “Introduction To Animal Communication-Breaking The Inter-Species Code.”\r\n \r\nJane’s pro bono & community volunteer work includes; facilitating communication for children with special needs, her “save the bees” project in Equador and locally, translating for big cats (tiger, leopard, cougar & lion) at a local sanctuary and Directing Portland IANDS (International Assoc. Near-Death Studies).  Jane has donated time teaching her children’s art,\r\nmindfulness and creativity curriculum art in schools for 10 years.\r\n\r\nJane is a devoted mother, wife, daughter, gardener, and beekeeper who\r\nloves hiking, music and living in the Pacific Northwest.\r\n\r\n“Jane deForest’s work is absolutely lovely. Artists have so much to contribute to our effort of making this a better world, for art speaks to the inner self”\r\nJane Goodall, Ph.D.\r\nAuthor of *In the Shadow of Man* and founder of the Jane Goodall Institute\r\n\r\n“Jane deForest is a true visionary. Her art is a gift of spirit that connects the\r\nviewer to the heart of the Sacred. Jane’s images are powerful transmissions that can change consciousness and help bring clarity, kindness and\r\ncompassion into the world”.\r\nJoan Borysenko, Ph.D. Author of *A Woman’s Journey to God*\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Author:\r\n\r\nBorn in New York City and raised in the Midwest, Jane DeForest grew up surrounded by giant elms, vast cornfields and a richly cultural homelife. Not only could she discern the thoughts of others, see non-physical beings and communicate with them, she knew when grown-ups were fibbing...which caused a variety of problems.  She also knew at an early age that she was an artist.  She attended amazing schools like the Interlochen Arts Academy, while the Rhode Island School of Design taught her to refine her craft. \r\n\r\nHer remarkable family -- brilliant, talented and devoted -- dragged her to museums around the world and encouraged out-of-the-box thinking. Severe dyslexia inhibited her scholarly interests, but allowed for alternative intuitive systems to develop naturally. Years of solitary painting of murals and commissioned canvases somehow taught her to absorb non-linear information through osmosis. \r\n\r\nHer clients eventually wanted her to "read" them psychically.  After formal training, her work shifted to illustrating through images the invisible world behind her eyes. She learned an antiquated technique of drawing, and at the same time, developed a reputation for achieving very high accuracy in intuitive consultations or psychic readings. She utilizes a variety of skills during psychic, intuitive coaching & consultations: \r\n\r\n--    Medium or mediumship which is a formal way of describing spirit communication or talking \r\nto dead people, if you will. \r\n\r\n--    Psychic animal (horse, dog, cat & bee) communication or inter-species ESP or trans-species \r\nmental telepathy. \r\n\r\n--    Grid surfing or remote viewing, which is intuitively viewing another location and \r\nrendering accurate drawings of specific things. \r\n\r\n--    Psychic time travel, which is basically grid surfing or remote viewing a past event or a \r\nfuture event. \r\n\r\n--    Energy clearing or debugging, many people have psychic garbage stuck to them inhibiting \r\nhealing, growth for general happiness.  \r\n\r\n--    General assessment of an individual's mental, spiritual and physical energy field. \r\n\r\n--    General relationship assessment of a couple's mental and physical energy field dynamic. \r\nHere she works on cultivation a strong spiritual connection to fortify the groundwork for a \r\ndeeper relationship.\r\n\r\nIn addition to writing, coaching and teaching workshops, she also loves to garden, cook and hike with her family in the beautiful northern rainforest of the Pacific Northwest. She is a community volunteer and donates time teaching art in schools; she's recently taken up helping to save the bee population in her area. In her pro-bono work, she uses ESP to help kids with severe disabilities who can't communicate in traditional fashion. \r\n\r\nFor more information go to www.janesinspiration.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n	2019-04-13	2017-11-25 18:43:43.576208	2019-02-03 21:48:26.371315	<p>Artist.

She utilizes a variety of skills during psychic, intuitive coaching &amp; consultations: </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    Medium or mediumship which is a formal way of describing spirit communication or talking \nto dead people, if you will. </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    Psychic animal (horse, dog, cat &amp; bee) communication or inter-species ESP or trans-species \nmental telepathy. </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    Grid surfing or remote viewing, which is intuitively viewing another location and \nrendering accurate drawings of specific things. </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    Psychic time travel, which is basically grid surfing or remote viewing a past event or a \nfuture event. </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    Energy clearing or debugging, many people have psychic garbage stuck to them inhibiting \nhealing, growth for general happiness.  </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    General assessment of an individual&rsquo;s mental, spiritual and physical energy field. </p>\n\n<p>&ndash;    General relationship assessment of a couple&rsquo;s mental and physical energy field dynamic. \nHere she works on cultivation a strong spiritual connection to fortify the groundwork for a \ndeeper relationship.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to writing, coaching and teaching workshops, she also loves to garden, cook and hike with her family in the beautiful northern rainforest of the Pacific Northwest. She is a community volunteer and donates time teaching art in schools; she&rsquo;s recently taken up helping to save the bee population in her area. In her pro-bono work, she uses ESP to help kids with severe disabilities who can&rsquo;t communicate in traditional fashion. </p>\n\n<p>For more information go to <a href="http://www.janesinspiration.com">www.janesinspiration.com</a>.</p>\n	f
240	Guest Speaker:  Bob Frank	Metaphysical Theorist; cyber security officer; author of mysteries; Topic - Exploring Reality: An Evidential Model; formerly IANDS' National President	\r\nBob Frank was raised on an Iowa farm and spent his summer afternoons in corn fields daydreaming of adventures in faraway lands. At seventeen, while war raged in Southeast Asia, he joined the Army and graduated from West Point as an airborne paratrooper. Most of his years of duty were spent staring at Russians on the iron curtain during the Cold War.\r\n\r\nFor much of the next twenty years he was an oil company cyber security road warrior traveling to every God forsaken corner of the world: Nigerian savannas, Saudi Arabian deserts and Sumatran jungles of Indonesia. His travels continued as he progressed through his career from high tech Silicon Valley “start-ups” to a Vice President of a Fortune 500 corporation to a cyber security expert to global enterprises.\r\n\r\nAlways known for fantastic storytelling, he kept the office intrigued and rolling with laughter from his adventures. When he finally ended his travels and left the corporate world, he set on a path to deliver entertainment and messages through writing.\r\n\r\nLater in his career, Bob began reading a mountain of non-fictional books on reincarnation, despite being a hard-core atheist/agnostic for 35 years. Then he wrote *The Third Eye Trilogy*, a series of mystery thrillers based on a time-travel concept of past life regression. \r\n\r\nTo prepare himself for writing the novels, he became a certified and registered hypnotherapist specializing in regression therapy. Every session that he performed lured him deeper into the non-materialistic, metaphysical realm. This led him into studying the plethora of research on all topics of metaphysics.\r\n\r\nHis in-depth engagement in metaphysics led him into world of near-death experiences and IANDS, the International Association for Near Death Studies (IANDS). He was most recently the president of IANDS for the last two years, concluding service after six years on the Board of Directors. \r\n\r\nBob splits his time between his mountain home in Panama and San Jose, California. He continues his research and returned to metaphysical writing, deriving a theory on reality to taunt both scientific and spiritual communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopic:  Exploring Reality: An Evidential Model\r\nBob Frank, Metaphysical Theorist\r\n\r\n\r\nScience, religion, philosophers, spiritualists and atheists alike, all present a partial, skewed and shrouded view of reality. Their hardened viewpoints typically come from prejudicial, influence driven oft-times illogical descriptions of reality. Many times their views of reality are in direct conflict to opposing views or absolute evidence before us.   It is not possible that all of these views are correct. There is only one true reality.  \r\n\r\nBob presents an evidential model of reality intending to prompt others to derive their own model based on facts and evidence before us.  Perhaps others will derive a model similar to what he presents. Through debate on differing models of reality, as a society we can invest in research to refine data to support or refute these models.\r\n	2019-03-09	2017-11-25 18:43:01.365085	2019-01-18 02:43:53.484906	<p>Bob Frank was raised on an Iowa farm and spent his summer afternoons in corn fields daydreaming of adventures in faraway lands.

244	Guest Speaker:  Virginia Jablonski	NDEr; Animal Communicator, Healer	In 2001 Ginny retired from a career in the field of private security to focus on resolving emerging medical issues, including debilitating pain and fatigue.  From the very first consultation with doctors Ginny was prescribed narcotics which she adamantly refused. She believed her issues would quickly be resolved and she would return to the profession she loved.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed by so did multiple misdiagnoses and a litany of non-narcotic prescription medications.  Eight years later in 2009 her doctor announced that he had given up trying to find the cause of her symptoms and handed her a Fentanyl lollipop.  \r\n\r\nBelieving her medical doctors that there was “no other option” to treat her chronic pain she resolved that she would not be returning to work and surrendered to the allopathic/mainstream medical solution: opioids. Over the years, as her body continuously built up a tolerance to the Fentanyl, Ginny’s doctor continued to increase the dosage to 125 mcg.  \r\n\r\nIn 2013 Ginny’s heart stopped beating in the middle of the night and she had a Near-Death Experience (NDE). In this experience she was transported out of her body into a bright white light and given the option to leave her life by a man who looked very much like Jesus. Although it was very tempting to leave this life behind, she chose to return as she felt there was something important she needed to accomplish. There were many horses and donkeys present during this experience and they were encouraging her to return to her life.\r\n\r\nShe knew that she had to discontinue Fentanyl if she wanted to live. Her doctors offered no help, in fact they did not recommend discontinuing the medication stating that no patient had ever done so. In her desire to regain her health she eagerly pursued complementary therapies and healing which she had no previous knowledge of or exposure to whatsoever. Like many experiencers have done she researched a variety of religious philosophies, alternative healing modalities and traveled extensively to receive healing from many "masters." \r\n\r\nBy January 2015 Ginny was able to completely break free of all opioid prescription medications. As Ginny was navigating her healing and spiritual education she realized that she could see various types of energy around humans and animals, and she was able to communicate with animals and non-physical spirits telepathically. She desperately wanted to understand what she was seeing and hearing, and more importantly why it was happening to her.\r\n\r\nThroughout her travels and healing experiences Ginny has pursued numerous certifications in energy healing modalities for both humans and animals. She eagerly promotes a compassionate message of forgiveness and oneness with her clients and in public venues where she promotes complementary healing modalities.\r\n\r\n\r\nGinny also had two Spiritually Transformative Experiences (STEs):\r\nFirst, falling off the back of a motorcycle in 1994 and an invisible hand put her back on. Second, driving a car 85 mph in the fast lane, she passed out and woke up in a parking lot off the freeway.\r\n\r\nRecently, Ginny has become active in lobbying at the state(s) and federal levels regarding the opioid crisis.  She continues to reach out to various groups with her story in an effort to support the field of chiropractic medicine and other complementary healing modalities in the hopes that we can potentially limit the future use of unnecessary prescription drugs in our country. She is also passionate about sharing her NDE with others. \r\n\r\nFor more info, please see: redskyeranch@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	2019-07-13	2017-11-25 18:45:36.533502	2019-05-07 04:50:22.268809	<p>In 2001 Ginny retired from a career in the field of private security to focus on resolving emerging medical issues, including debilitating pain and fatigue.

Ellen Burstyn delivers a tour-de-force performance as a woman who experiences clinical death and returns to life with the amazing ability to heal others.

238	Movies! Movies! Movies!	Two excellent end-of-life movies. We are trying again and will make sure all of the equipment is fully functioning!  Bring your own popcorn!	These movies are entertaining and informative. No intermission. First movie begins promptly at 2 pm.\r\n\r\n**DEARLY DEPARTED** (2013) . Dearly Departed is a fictional documentary, based on actual near-death experiences, shot as though the camera was taken into the spirit world to conduct documentary-style interviews with the spirits of dead people to get their insights on life after death (84 min).\r\n\r\n**BETWEEN TWO WORLDS** (1944) - In London during World War II, married couple Henry (Paul Henreid) and Ann Bergner (Eleanor Parker) decide to commit suicide instead of waiting to be killed in a Nazi air raid. After carrying out their decision, the Bergners awake to find themselves on a large, mysterious ship with several other passengers. The ship's steward, Scrubby (Edmund Gwenn), informs them that the vessel is where the dead come to be judged. The passengers now must await the fate handed down to them by the Examiner.\r\n\r\nNazi bombs rain fire into an English port town. The smoke clears and a disparate group of human beings caught in the blast finds itself aboard a luxury liner headed...who knows where. They soon learn their one-way tickets are stamped Heaven. And Hell. A dose of World War II realism puts a gritty edge on this retelling of the early Talkie Outward Bound (starring Leslie Howard) that loses none of the prior version's ethereal power. A stellar cast - John Garfield, Paul Henried, Sydney Greenstreet, Eleanor Parker, Edmund Gwenn and more names evocative of a remarkable filmmaking era - bring their considerable talents to a tale of passengers who discover their true natures as they discover their destinations.

247	Guest Speaker: Barbara Ireland	NDEr, Author, Speaker, Workshop Trainer & Coach, Singer/Musician, and Filmmaker	In 2010, Barbara Ireland nearly died of heat stroke and hyponatremia (dangerously low levels of sodium in the blood) at a “self-improvement” camp in a remote area of Vancouver B.C. \r\n\r\nShe received three transformational truths during an astounding life review, which felt like four hours:  1. How unconscious negative thoughts (“mind loops”) had been the cause of tremendous suffering throughout her life, 2. Profound lessons about relationships, and 3. Profound lessons about her life priorities. \r\n\r\nThe experience was so impactful, she changed careers from a professional singer, to speaking, writing, and training others on how to stop “mind loops.”\r\n\r\nBarbara is author of the Amazon bestseller, *How To Stop Negative Thoughts: What My Near Death Experience Taught Me About Mind Loops, Neuroscience, and Happiness*, and contributing author to *The Transformative Power of Near-Death Experiences: How the Messages of NDEs Can Positively Impact the World* by Penny Sartori and Kelly Walsh.\r\n\r\nShe is founder of *The De-Looping Method* (which is based on information from her NDE), which uses neuroscience to interrupt repetitive, negative thoughts. Barbara trains both individuals and corporations to stop worry, low self esteem, and other negative thinking patterns. \r\n\r\nWORKSHOP INFO:\r\n\r\nBarbara will be doing a 2 hour workshop on Sunday, October 13, 1-3 p.m. at the Church of the Spirit, 2650 N. Central Park in Chicago. SHe will also be giving the sermon during the 10:30 a.m. service that day.\r\n\r\n>How To Tame “Mind Loops” of Worry and Anxiety With Neuroscience\r\n\r\nDo you repeatedly worry about potential problems? Feel anxious about health issues, finances, or relationships? Do you replay worst-case-scenarios and dramas in your head that leave you feeling stressed and exhausted? Too often our imagination runs away with us – and we develop a HABIT of anxious worry. Once we begin to “loop” over and over with worry about what COULD happen, we turn on the stress response and block the very parts of the brain we need for focus and creative solutions. Our ability to listen and communicate effectively both at home and work is undermined by anxiety, irritability, and increased reactivity. Based on knowledge Barbara received during her near-death experience plus current neuroscience, you will learn practical tools to train your mind to be your greatest ally, instead of your saboteur.\r\n\r\nBefore her NDE, Barbara had a successful career as a musician and jazz singer.  She has two CDs available and received her BFA degree from New York University in Filmmaking.

248	Guest Speaker:   PMH Atwater	World renowned researcher, intuitive, speaker, speaks about her NEW BOOK, "The Forever Angels"....4 NDEs; 	This project was inspired by her research of child experiencers of near-death states. She noticed that children born naturally from regular parents were exhibiting the same or similar traits to near-death kids, including synesthesia. Since this is clearly impossible, she considered evolutionary factors. When she did, not only did the traits match but so did the historical “upgrades” that influenced all the world’s various renaissances, the inception of the New Thought Movement, and the other sweeping shifts into states of higher consciousness that we have record of.\r\n\r\nBooks will be available at this talk that reference her work in this area.\r\n\r\nBio:\r\n\r\nBorn in Twin Falls, Idaho, Atwater married young and became a mother of three, Sunday School teacher, secretary, and prize winning cook.

After over fifteen years of intensive research, interviewing over 3,000 near-death survivors, her book “BEYOND THE LIGHT, WHAT ISN’T BElNG SAID ABOUT THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERlENCE”, represents the most complete compendium yet done of the phenomenon, its aftereffects and implications.\r\n\r\nAn international authority on near-death states, she has served two terms on the Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies.

She noticed that children born naturally from regular parents were exhibiting the same or similar traits to near-death kids, including synesthesia. Since this is clearly impossible, she considered evolutionary factors.

She immediately read the book and scheduled Reconnective Healing Sessions and The Reconnection. During the sessions she had a profound shift in awareness. \r\n\r\n​"It was as if The Reconnection opened a portal to a timeless knowingness across many planes of existence.  What unfolded during the Reconnection sessions was amazingly similar to my near death experience I had had years previously, but there was so much more.”  \r\n\r\nThis experience as well as the many healings and transformative life events she witnesses daily as people discover these new frequencies of light and information compels Joan to continue to facilitate the expansion of this wonderful work.  She also, collaborates with local area practitioners to promote public awareness of The Reconnection through cooperative advertising, public speaking, as well as practitioner mentoring, and Hospice work.\r\n\r\n​“Reconnective Healing expands into a new spectrum of light and information that is available to everyone exposed to this work. Once we interact with these frequencies we are forever changed. It transcends technique and frees us to experience more."\r\n\r\n​Joan feels that The Reconnection offers a gateway or opening which accelerates our evolution on many levels.

250	Guest Speaker:   Chris Fleming	3+ NDEs, Astral Traveler, TV paranormal documentaries, Spiritual Consultant & Medium, Psychic Investigator, Spirit Artist	Chris Fleming is an internationally known paranormal investigator, medium and spiritual consultant who has been investigating the supernatural since his childhood. For over 48 years, Chris has been using his sixth sense to read people, predict events and communicate with the afterlife. \r\n\r\nChris is the co-presenter on the current UKTV series “ Help! My House Is Haunted” and has presented on other paranormal TV shows such as Dead Famous, 2 seasons of Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal, and made guest appearances on Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, Ghost Adventures LIVE,  and more.\r\n\r\nKnown worldwide for his contributions of new techniques and technology for the paranormal field, Chris introduced the direct response method of communication with the K-II Meter, and is the co-creator of the SB7 Spirit Box, currently the world's leading direct radio voice box. \r\n\r\nContinuing to inspire people throughout the country, Chris holds lectures and workshops about extra sensory perception, higher consciousness, the sixth sense, life after death, and the evidence to support the existence of ghosts. He also consults clients, creates spirit art, hosts a monthly podcast called “Spirit Talk” and sells ghost hunting equipment online, while investigating sensitive haunting cases involving families, or children, in fear of their own psychic abilities.\r\n\r\nOutside of the paranormal, Chris writes and produces content for television and film, and is currently writing his first memoir. Chris continues his research in higher consciousness and experimenting in better ways to communicate with the afterlife using audio technology. \r\n\r\nChris Fleming will be sharing some of his stories on Jan 11, 2020. \r\n\r\nHe had an induced out of body experience in 2006 and a near death experience back in 2009 shortly after a car accident. Due to his head and neck injuries what followed were a couple more instances where he stopped breathing during sleep, and found himself floating above his body.

What he was shown quickly changed his mind and set him on a new path.  \r\n\r\nChris will be speaking about the experiences he had out of body and on the other side, what he learned, and what he discovered years later not only about our soul, but about how our consciousness truly is connected to a greater source.

251	Guest Speaker:   Toni Winninger	2 NDEs, Channeler, Author of 8 books about the other side....	From medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, Toni always sought “The Answer.” In those days she had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present her perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly. \r\n\r\nIn those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist. If a motive or alibi could not be documented, she didn’t want to hear it. Her left brain, the hard-drive calculator part of her, was in charge. Never feeling emotions because they got in the way of deduction, she could not accept something based upon hearsay—how would she ever prove to someone else beyond a reasonable doubt that a non-physical energy or an emotion had an impact upon the physical?\r\n\r\nThen one day, while walking her dog in the forest preserve, she heard a voice say, “Why do you hate yourself?” Now, with such a rational background, you would think that her first reaction would be to ignore any voice since it was quite evident that the only two physical beings in those trees were the dog and Toni—but she didn’t. Although she saw no one, she did feel a presence, so she followed usual court behavior and started arguing with the voice: It was wrong; she didn’t hate herself; where did it ever get such an idea? Back and forth they went until quite exhausted. Then came a new question: “Well then, let’s start with what you don’t like about yourself.” The flood gates burst open and, for the first time in her life, she let her emotions out.\r\n\r\nThat simple walk in the woods started an inner search for the real Toni Ann Winninger. Who was she really? What was she hiding deep inside? What was she running away from? And on, and on, and on, until she began to walk down her soul’s spiritual pathway. She envied people who could communicate with their guides. Raised Catholic, she was pretty sure there were such things as guardian angels—the nuns used to give her little cards with their pictures on them. A mentor of hers, through hypnotherapy, then helped her open her doors to her personal guides, which started a dialogue that continues to this day.\r\n\r\nWhile she was getting ready to retire from her position as a senior criminal prosecuting trial attorney with the Cook County (Chicago) State’s Attorney’s Office, her guides recruited her to be their voice to the world. She did not even know what a channeler was when they told her they wanted her to convey their messages to others. Now she translates messages from them weekly and places them on the website they had her construct for that purpose.\r\n\r\nDoes she know “beyond a reasonable doubt” that these spiritual guides exist? Absolutely! During her years of doing readings for people, they have delivered messages through her, time and again, which she has seen create positive change in people’s lives. They constantly give her information, the truth of which she has absolutely no way of knowing, yet she does know with certainty now because she can feel their energy, their sincerity, their mirth, and best of all, their unconditional love for all of us incarnate here on planet Earth. \r\n\r\nThe Masters of the Spirit World simply ask her to take the energetic vibrations that they send through her and tune them, translate them, for all the world to have. What are you to do with those words? The same as she does. You must use your freedom of choice to feel whether they should be part of your reality, and if so, then you may embrace them as she embraces her work for the non-physical, wonderful beings at Home on the other side.\r\n\r\nToni had her first NDE during a tonsillectomy at the age of 7. It scared her because of an emergency with another patient just as she was coming back. Her next one occurred at 15 when she dove off a cliff, slipped launching herself, propelling her into an overhang. She had a life review and a lot of things felt different afterwards. Shortly thereafter she was talked out of most of her feelings by the nuns in high school. Everything became very physically judgmental until the above incident. Since then she has had OBEs and constant contact with the non-physical world.\r\n\r\nShe has channeled eight books and two pamphlets. She travels the world doing channeling, presenting workshops, and teaching self-help spiritual enlightenment courses. She has been working in Singapore, Hong Kong, all over Malaysia, all over the United Kingdom and in Paris. She has Skype and phone clients all over the world including Germany, Brazil, Spain, Australia, Costa Rico just to mention a few.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more informations, please see:  www.mastersofthespiritworld.com\r\n	2020-02-08	2019-04-28 07:12:04.248855	2020-01-07 20:14:35.047601	<p>From medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, Toni always sought “The Answer.” In those days she had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present her perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly. </p>\n\n<p>In those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist.

245	Guest Speaker:  Carolyn Clapper	NDEr,  Evidential and Medical Medium, works with 5 doctors on the other side, from Racine, WI.	Carolyn Clapper was born in an old Victorian home in Racine, WI, in 1978. She had a relatively normal childhood, except that she was always able to hear and see spirits.  She knew that previous family and friends were around us, but she didn’t know that she was unusual for knowing that.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolyn recognized at an early age that her life was to be one of service.   As she grew up, she was guided to use her creative talents in Massage, Music and Art to help others. After high school, she received a degree in Massage Therapy from the Wisconsin Institute of Natural Wellness, where she continued to work, until she enrolled in an Art Therapy degree program at Mount Mary University.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, as a single mom of a five year old son, she lost both parents to cancer and was in the midst of a brutal divorce, when she became violently ill.  Doctors were stymied by her severe symptoms, which included a high fever and projectile vomiting.\r\n\r\nAfter eight hours in the Emergency Room, she heard her mother whisper to her (from the other side) that she had Meningitis. She passed that life-saving information along and the doctors began tests to determine that she did indeed have both viral and bacterial Meningitis.\r\n\r\nCarolyn was healed on 11/11/11. During that miraculous process, she had a full-blown Near-Death Experience and went to the other side.  She returned, but her intense connection to the other side continued, blossoming into her true calling as a stunning psychic medium and allowing her easy access to those in the Next World.\r\n\r\nAs she recovered, she began working with a team of five medical doctors on the other side to help diagnose and provide in depth information which can potentially save a life or offer a better quality of life. And the results have been dramatic. She realized that she is to share this gift and now pursues evidential and medical mediumship as her full time occupation.\r\n\r\nKnown both nationally and internationally as *The Next World Medium*, she works in missing persons cases, unsolved homicide, and medical mysteries.  She has located missing persons both deceased and alive, and has found confirmed illnesses in many.  \r\n\r\nFor more information, please see:    http://www.thenextworldmedium.com\r\n	2019-08-10	2017-11-25 18:46:04.305601	2019-08-09 18:12:45.165573	<p>Carolyn Clapper was born in an old Victorian home in Racine, WI, in 1978.

260	Guest Speaker:   Robert Bare	2 NDEs; Vice President of IANDS, 20 Years as a California Highway Patrolman	You have to have a tough mentality to be a police officer, and Robert Bare spent more than two decades as a California Highway Patrolman, including time serving the Bay area. “I saw lots of death, and I became callous,” he says. Spirituality or religion played no role in his life.\r\n\r\nBut his Near-Death Experience shook him to his core. It occurred shortly after he boarded a plane in March, 2009. He had a massive heart attack and was deceased for approximately 45 minutes. His NDE was profiled in the TV Show *I Survived… Beyond and Back*, and he was a featured case study by author Debra Diamond in her book, Life After Near Death. \r\n\r\n“Accompanied by loving beings, I gravitated toward a beautiful bright Light,” Robert recalls. “I saw some colors I had never seen before. I remember being in the presence of a Higher Power who talked to me. I had a Life Review and saw everything that I had experienced in my life.” He calls the review “the reckoning of my life… a humbling experience.”\r\n\r\n“I could see everything in my life, but I was also in it, and I could read everyone’s mind. I realized that I could have done better, and I did not want to judge or hurt anyone anymore.”\r\nTaken to a hospital, he had a second NDE, floating above the operating room, observing what was transpiring below. This NDE included a pivotal moment: he could hear medical staff talking about him while he was unconscious. Later, the doctors verified that he had indeed heard their conversation.\r\n\r\n“I’m a different person now,” Robert says.  “Now I only want to do good in my life.”\r\nAfter he was elected Vice President of IANDS in 2019, Robert was interviewed for William Shatner's *Unexplained* show on the History Channel, and became a panelist at the IANDS International Conference in Philadelphia (2019), and he has been the topic of several research studies. \r\n\r\nRobert has more recently taken on the role of Vice-President of Spiritual Awakenings International with Dr. Yvonne Kason.

261	Guest Speaker:   Toni Winninger	Special Channeled readings....Toni will interview some famous people who have passed.   We will be accepting requests.   Watch for more info in our monthly newsletter.	From medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, Toni always sought “The Answer.” In those days she had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present her perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly.\r\n\r\nIn those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist. If a motive or alibi could not be documented, she didn’t want to hear it. Her left brain, the hard-drive calculator part of her, was in charge. Never feeling emotions because they got in the way of deduction, she could not accept something based upon hearsay—how would she ever prove to someone else beyond a reasonable doubt that a non-physical energy or an emotion had an impact upon the physical?\r\n\r\nThen one day, while walking her dog in the forest preserve, she heard a voice say, “Why do you hate yourself?” Now, with such a rational background, you would think that her first reaction would be to ignore any voice since it was quite evident that the only two physical beings in those trees were the dog and Toni—but she didn’t. Although she saw no one, she did feel a presence, so she followed usual court behavior and started arguing with the voice: It was wrong; she didn’t hate herself; where did it ever get such an idea? Back and forth they went until quite exhausted. Then came a new question: “Well then, let’s start with what you don’t like about yourself.” The flood gates burst open and, for the first time in her life, she let her emotions out.\r\n\r\nThat simple walk in the woods started an inner search for the real Toni Ann Winninger. Who was she really? What was she hiding deep inside? What was she running away from? And on, and on, and on, until she began to walk down her soul’s spiritual pathway. She envied people who could communicate with their guides. Raised Catholic, she was pretty sure there were such things as guardian angels—the nuns used to give her little cards with their pictures on them. A mentor of hers, through hypnotherapy, then helped her open her doors to her personal guides, which started a dialogue that continues to this day.\r\n\r\nWhile she was getting ready to retire from her position as a senior criminal prosecuting trial attorney with the Cook County (Chicago) State’s Attorney’s Office, her guides recruited her to be their voice to the world. She did not even know what a channeler was when they told her they wanted her to convey their messages to others. Now she translates messages from them weekly and places them on the website they had her construct for that purpose.\r\n\r\nDoes she know “beyond a reasonable doubt” that these spiritual guides exist? Absolutely! During her years of doing readings for people, they have delivered messages through her, time and again, which she has seen create positive change in people’s lives. They constantly give her information, the truth of which she has absolutely no way of knowing, yet she does know with certainty now because she can feel their energy, their sincerity, their mirth, and best of all, their unconditional love for all of us incarnate here on planet Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Masters of the Spirit World simply ask her to take the energetic vibrations that they send through her and tune them, translate them, for all the world to have. What are you to do with those words? The same as she does. You must use your freedom of choice to feel whether they should be part of your reality, and if so, then you may embrace them as she embraces her work for the non-physical, wonderful beings at Home on the other side.\r\n\r\nToni had her first NDE during a tonsillectomy at the age of 7. It scared her because of an emergency with another patient just as she was coming back. Her next one occurred at 15 when she dove off a cliff, slipped launching herself, propelling her into an overhang. She had a life review and a lot of things felt different afterwards. Shortly thereafter she was talked out of most of her feelings by the nuns in high school. Everything became very physically judgmental until the above incident. Since then she has had OBEs and constant contact with the non-physical world.\r\n\r\nShe has channeled eight books and two pamphlets. She travels the world doing channeling, presenting workshops, and teaching self-help spiritual enlightenment courses. She has been working in Singapore, Hong Kong, all over Malaysia, all over the United Kingdom and in Paris. She has Skype and phone clients all over the world including Germany, Brazil, Spain, Australia, Costa Rico just to mention a few.\r\n\r\nFor more informations, please see: www.mastersofthespiritworld.com	2020-12-12	2019-12-04 17:34:53.644039	2020-08-05 06:07:15.639438	<p>From medical technologist to social worker, then from sales representative to director of education of a paramedical trade school, and finally as a lawyer serving for 27 years as a state prosecutor, Toni always sought “The Answer.” In those days she had an insatiable desire to know the factual basis of everything encountered, and to learn what was needed to present her perception of the facts to others, cogently and convincingly.</p>\n\n<p>In those days you would have been told that if you couldn’t pick something up and throw it, then it didn’t exist.

14	Aftereffects of My Near-Death Experience	Anonymous	(The first paragraph here has been added 8/29/11.) The following are\r\nsome of the aftereffects I experienced after my near-death experience\r\n(NDE). I didn't know what an NDE was until eight years later, so some\r\nof the events were frightening to me. I wrote this so that other people\r\nwho have had NDEs know that what they experienced is normal. In 1991 I\r\nwas led to find the book, Heading towards Omega, by Kenneth L. Ring.\r\nThis book told stories of people's near-death experiences, but most\r\nimportantly what happened to their lives afterward. Reading it, I\r\ndidn't feel alone anymore or weird as my values and perceptions of life\r\nchanged. Later, I found the book, Beyond the Life, By P.M. H Atwater\r\nwhich explains the physical, mental, spiritual, and relationship\r\nchanges. Her other book, Children of the New Millennium, explains the\r\ndifference with children's NDE's and also an unexpected challenging\r\nphase of my life. The following are brief scenarios. Over time much has\r\nchanged around and after these events. I have made it successfully\r\nthrough the second drop, and have been experiencing a peaceful,\r\nprosperous, integrated connection to people, Heaven and my life purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following was written in 2001: I had a near-death experience on\r\nJanuary 4, 1982 after a misdiagnosed\r\nruptured ectopic pregnancy. Four days I laid in a hospital bed before\r\n"emergency surgery" was done. I don't remember much of the details of\r\nthe NDE other then looking down from the ceiling at my body in the\r\nhospital bed. Later, I woke up with the question "What have I been\r\ndoing with my life?" repeating again and again in my head. The\r\nfollowing is an account of the aftereffects of my near-death experience.\r\n\r\n ## First Seven Years:\r\n\r\n Immediately after the near-death experience and for the following year,\r\nI grieved for the loss of my baby. Yet I also felt almost blissful.\r\nPerhaps I brought back some of the peace I had experienced on the other\r\nside. I became more outgoing and less shy. The question "What have I\r\nbeen doing with my life?" remained in my head. I began changing my life\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n I returned to college where I made several friends and acquaintances\r\nwhich gave me a social life that I did not have before. In nursing\r\nschool, I discovered that I really didn't need to study. After a while\r\nI was falling asleep whenever I opened a textbook, but I still excelled\r\non tests. It was like I "inhaled" the lectures even though this\r\nincluded subjects with a lot of material such as pharmacology,\r\nmicrobiology, anatomy and physiology and of course, nursing as it\r\nrelated to each disease from infancy to old age.\r\n\r\n My husband could not deal with the changes in my life or my blossoming\r\npersonality--mostly because he was no longer the center of my attention\r\nas I had new other interests. I still cared for him and our home but I\r\nnow had a life too. Basically he was wasting his life out in the streets\r\nand not home much anyway. After the near-death experience, I chose not\r\nto enable him anymore. I used to make sure he was awake to go to work\r\nafter he had been out all night. We had three alarm clocks in the\r\nbedroom set at different times and he still would not get up unless I\r\npoked and yelled at him. My clinical rotations were on different shifts\r\nthe next semester, so I was not there anyway. I stopped covering up for\r\nhim and things went from bad to worse. We divorced soon after I\r\ngraduated.\r\n\r\n In the seventh year I started to have psychic experiences. My mother's\r\nspirit visited me for three nights in a row. She had disappeared almost\r\n12 years earlier. I couldn't stand crowds, even 5-7 people, because I\r\nfelt other people's physical as well as emotional pain. One day, I\r\nexperienced both day and night at the same time. In other words, it was\r\ndaytime but as I walked along outside, what I saw, felt and experienced\r\nwas nighttime for a short while. While writing, my pen and hand often\r\ntook off by themselves. I saw several of my past lives.\r\n\r\n Physically, I would get terrible stomach aches that would last two days\r\nwhenever I would eat meat. I developed allergies to gluten, dairy, cats,\r\nmold and medications that didn't bother me before. Lights, music and\r\nviolent media became intolerable. For years I didn't have a television\r\nin my home and rarely turned on the radio. Watches with batteries\r\nstopped soon after being on my wrist. Initially I actually blamed my\r\nmother-in-law for giving me cheap gifts. However, when I purchased my\r\nown watches, the same thing happened. Eventually, I tired of replacing\r\nbatteries and stopped wearing watches.\r\n\r\n ## Seven to Fourteenth Years:\r\n\r\n During the eighth year, the psychic experiences escalated to\r\nunbearable.\r\nI knew about the Gulf War before it was announced in the media, having\r\nseen and felt the terror of the women and children running down the\r\nstreet from the orange flames for several nights prior. Four months\r\nafter the war ended the US admitted it bombed civilians.\r\n\r\n I knew when the phone and doorbell would ring who would be there. But I\r\nalso knew what people were thinking and believe me you don't want to\r\nknow when your friends are not telling the truth. It was horrible! So I\r\nprayed for God to remove this ability from me. It lasted three weeks and\r\nthen begin to decrease to a more tolerable level. Over the years it has\r\nbecome barely perceptible. I am aware that it still exists but I can\r\nchoose when to respond. I continued to know about events happening on\r\nthe other side of the world and the Oklahoma bombing, mostly in the form\r\nof extreme anxiety instead of visually, hour prior to the news\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\n Other unsettling incidences were visual images involving young\r\nchildren,\r\njust minutes before potentially dangerous accidents happened. I was\r\ndozing on a stalled chartered bus parked on the side of the highway,\r\nwaiting for repairs. I kept seeing a little boy running out onto the\r\nhighway. I got up out of my seat, looking around I saw a real little boy\r\nplaying on the grass several feet from the bus. I told another woman\r\nsitting across the aisle. She said the father was watching him so I sat\r\ndown and closed my eyes. Again, I saw the little boy running out onto\r\nthe highway. I looked out the window and he was running out onto the\r\nhighway. I leaped off the bus and onto the highway, grabbing him without\r\nany thought for my life.\r\n\r\n A similar thing happened soon after this when I was at my sister's\r\nhome\r\nand I saw an image of my toddling nephew falling down the stairs. His\r\nmother and my sister were both standing close to him so I assumed they\r\nwere watching him. I was on the other side of the room. He fell\r\npartially down the carpeted stairs and was okay, but I wasn't. I was\r\nshook up that the responsibility was on me to save the children because\r\nI saw it and the parents didn't and to keep my mouth shut so as not to\r\nembarrass them (or myself).\r\n\r\n Some premonitions and events have actually been humorous. I dreamed\r\nabout a friend's pregnancy in another city before she even knew she was\r\npregnant. Funny thing--in the dream she was craving chicken so a mutual\r\nfriend and I were driving around in the middle of the night trying to\r\nfind an open chicken restaurant and we were all vegetarian! I told her\r\nand she denied she was pregnant. Her daughter is four years old now.\r\n\r\n Have you ever forgotten to turn off the stove and come home hours later\r\nto find the food and the pot safe as if time has been put on hold? If\r\nI'd been at home it would have been hopelessly burnt for sure! Just\r\ncurious if this is common. This has happened to me several times.\r\n\r\n There have also been several deja vu experiences such as having a dream\r\nor a flash of an image and then several years later being in the place\r\nseen previously even though I'd never been there or even heard of it.\r\nSome occurred way across the USA or the world! Often the dreams were\r\nforgotten about as insignificant and then later I recognized the exact\r\nwords spoken and the previously unknown people. It's embarrassing to be\r\nstaring in awe as the recognition sinks in with tears streaming down\r\nyour cheeks in a room full of people. And you can't explain that you\r\nnow know you have made the right decision to take the risk to get there.\r\n\r\n One consolation has been an image of a field of flowers, mostly red,\r\nwhich instantly fills me with an incredible feeling of peace and\r\nrelaxation. It is the only memory of the near-death experience itself,\r\nother than looking down on my body. Since the NDE I've been on what\r\nseems like a never-ending search for that incredible peace and\r\nunconditional love on earth. The closest I have come to it was learning\r\nmeditation when I see very vividly colored fields of flowers and feel\r\nthe peace again.\r\n\r\n ## Fourteenth to Twentieth Years:\r\n\r\n These recent years have been quieter in terms of psychic and physical\r\nchanges, perhaps because I have integrated them into my life as more\r\nnormal. My allergies and sensitivities to light and noise is less. The\r\nmost significant development has been my ability to relate to people\r\ninstead of withdrawing from them because I didn't know how to handle\r\nthe vivid visual or dream information I would get about them.\r\n\r\n However some life changes since 1994 have been unsettling and\r\nchallenging. Some of this time has been wonderful and I have felt whole\r\nand fulfilled better than I ever can remember. But the years leading up\r\nto this and since then have been rough. I questioned my life purpose and\r\ndirection. Was I going backwards or forwards?\r\n\r\n At PMH Atwater's workshop in September, 2000, she gave us a handout\r\nwith the Brain Shift Phases of Integration Most Experiencers Go Through.\r\nI read Phase Four and gasped. But the above details from her book\r\nChildren of the New Millennium really explains much more and hits home.\r\nI cried when I read it because it explains so much of what I have been\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n I attempted suicide last year for the first time. Prior to this I had\r\nalways rationalized myself out of it. To most people it would not have\r\nlooked like suicide. It just would have looked like heatstroke because I\r\nchose not to open a window or turn a fan on. I don't know if it was\r\npossible for me to even die that way. But it is interesting that I had\r\nan abnormal cardiac stress test earlier that month before the suicide\r\nattempt. I had already given my body a "die message."\r\n\r\n 1999 was hell! It started January 1999 and ended December 31st. I lost\r\nmy health, had no income, became homeless, lost all my friends, moved to\r\na foreign side of town. Then doctors, public aid and other social\r\nagencies refused to help. I had made major sacrifices with following my\r\nintuition/greater plan and then it seems that I had lost everything! In\r\nSeptember 1999 I almost died from a simple unidentified infection. What\r\na way to have to let go of all the false roles and identities I had.\r\nTalk about major transition! It was either sink or swim.\r\n\r\n Reading Children of the New Millennium has been a blessing for me. Why\r\nis it that I usually get explanations after I have already been through\r\nthe worst of it? Imagine how I felt when I read the following:\r\n\r\n     \r\n    "Somewhere between the twelfth and fourteenth years and, maybe up to\r\n    the twentieth, there is another marker--a second birthday--and it\r\n    catches most experiencers unaware.  It is a second drop --a second\r\n    shift.\r\n    \r\n    The second drop is like a second death, in that it heralds a time of\r\n    life reversals and the need to ask some tough questions:  Were the\r\n    sacrifices I have made since my experience worth it?  Are my\r\n    aftereffects fading?  If the experience can successfully negotiate\r\n    the challenges of this second drop, a second shift is possible--a\r\n    major advancement toward "the peace that passes all\r\n    understanding."....\r\n    \r\n    Of those who attempted suicide after their episode, all of them\r\n    (children) did so during Phase Four.  Also, most of those who had\r\n    another near-death experience in adulthood had it in Phase Four....\r\n    \r\n    The second drop that occurs is not always as perilous as it was for\r\n    the young man just mentioned, but, unlike the 'first birthday', this\r\n    is a time of reckoning and reassessment when experiencers make major\r\n    decisions that require new commitment.  The first shift can be\r\nlinked\r\n    to the original near-death state.  The second shift is more\r\ndependent\r\n    on choice, on the experiencer's willingness to surrender to a\r\ngreater\r\n    plan.

The following are\nsome of the aftereffects I experienced after my near-death experience\n(NDE). I didn&#39;t know what an NDE was until eight years later, so some\nof the events were frightening to me. I wrote this so that other people\nwho have had NDEs know that what they experienced is normal. In 1991 I\nwas led to find the book, Heading towards Omega, by Kenneth L. Ring.\nThis book told stories of people&#39;s near-death experiences, but most\nimportantly what happened to their lives afterward. Reading it, I\ndidn&#39;t feel alone anymore or weird as my values and perceptions of life\nchanged. Later, I found the book, Beyond the Life, By P.M. H Atwater\nwhich explains the physical, mental, spiritual, and relationship\nchanges. Her other book, Children of the New Millennium, explains the\ndifference with children&#39;s NDE&#39;s and also an unexpected challenging\nphase of my life. The following are brief scenarios. Over time much has\nchanged around and after these events. I have made it successfully\nthrough the second drop, and have been experiencing a peaceful,\nprosperous, integrated connection to people, Heaven and my life purpose.</p>\n\n<p>The following was written in 2001: I had a near-death experience on\nJanuary 4, 1982 after a misdiagnosed\nruptured ectopic pregnancy. Four days I laid in a hospital bed before\n&ldquo;emergency surgery&rdquo; was done. I don&#39;t remember much of the details of\nthe NDE other then looking down from the ceiling at my body in the\nhospital bed. Later, I woke up with the question &ldquo;What have I been\ndoing with my life?&rdquo; repeating again and again in my head. The\nfollowing is an account of the aftereffects of my near-death experience.</p>\n\n<p>## First Seven Years:</p>\n\n<p>Immediately after the near-death experience and for the following year,\nI grieved for the loss of my baby. Yet I also felt almost blissful.\nPerhaps I brought back some of the peace I had experienced on the other\nside. I became more outgoing and less shy. The question &ldquo;What have I\nbeen doing with my life?&rdquo; remained in my head. I began changing my life\naccordingly.</p>\n\n<p>I returned to college where I made several friends and acquaintances\nwhich gave me a social life that I did not have before. In nursing\nschool, I discovered that I really didn&#39;t need to study. After a while\nI was falling asleep whenever I opened a textbook, but I still excelled\non tests. It was like I &ldquo;inhaled&rdquo; the lectures even though this\nincluded subjects with a lot of material such as pharmacology,\nmicrobiology, anatomy and physiology and of course, nursing as it\nrelated to each disease from infancy to old age.</p>\n\n<p>My husband could not deal with the changes in my life or my blossoming\npersonality&ndash;mostly because he was no longer the center of my attention\nas I had new other interests. I still cared for him and our home but I\nnow had a life too. Basically he was wasting his life out in the streets\nand not home much anyway. After the near-death experience, I chose not\nto enable him anymore. I used to make sure he was awake to go to work\nafter he had been out all night. We had three alarm clocks in the\nbedroom set at different times and he still would not get up unless I\npoked and yelled at him. My clinical rotations were on different shifts\nthe next semester, so I was not there anyway. I stopped covering up for\nhim and things went from bad to worse. We divorced soon after I\ngraduated.</p>\n\n<p>In the seventh year I started to have psychic experiences. My mother&#39;s\nspirit visited me for three nights in a row. She had disappeared almost\n12 years earlier. I couldn&#39;t stand crowds, even 5-7 people, because I\nfelt other people&#39;s physical as well as emotional pain. One day, I\nexperienced both day and night at the same time. In other words, it was\ndaytime but as I walked along outside, what I saw, felt and experienced\nwas nighttime for a short while. While writing, my pen and hand often\ntook off by themselves. I saw several of my past lives.</p>\n\n<p>Physically, I would get terrible stomach aches that would last two days\nwhenever I would eat meat. I developed allergies to gluten, dairy, cats,\nmold and medications that didn&#39;t bother me before. Lights, music and\nviolent media became intolerable. For years I didn&#39;t have a television\nin my home and rarely turned on the radio. Watches with batteries\nstopped soon after being on my wrist. Initially I actually blamed my\nmother-in-law for giving me cheap gifts. However, when I purchased my\nown watches, the same thing happened. Eventually, I tired of replacing\nbatteries and stopped wearing watches.</p>\n\n<p>## Seven to Fourteenth Years:</p>\n\n<p>During the eighth year, the psychic experiences escalated to\nunbearable.\nI knew about the Gulf War before it was announced in the media, having\nseen and felt the terror of the women and children running down the\nstreet from the orange flames for several nights prior. Four months\nafter the war ended the US admitted it bombed civilians.</p>\n\n<p>I knew when the phone and doorbell would ring who would be there. But I\nalso knew what people were thinking and believe me you don&#39;t want to\nknow when your friends are not telling the truth. It was horrible! So I\nprayed for God to remove this ability from me. It lasted three weeks and\nthen begin to decrease to a more tolerable level. Over the years it has\nbecome barely perceptible. I am aware that it still exists but I can\nchoose when to respond. I continued to know about events happening on\nthe other side of the world and the Oklahoma bombing, mostly in the form\nof extreme anxiety instead of visually, hour prior to the news\nbroadcast.</p>\n\n<p>Other unsettling incidences were visual images involving young\nchildren,\njust minutes before potentially dangerous accidents happened. I was\ndozing on a stalled chartered bus parked on the side of the highway,\nwaiting for repairs. I kept seeing a little boy running out onto the\nhighway. I got up out of my seat, looking around I saw a real little boy\nplaying on the grass several feet from the bus. I told another woman\nsitting across the aisle. She said the father was watching him so I sat\ndown and closed my eyes. Again, I saw the little boy running out onto\nthe highway. I looked out the window and he was running out onto the\nhighway. I leaped off the bus and onto the highway, grabbing him without\nany thought for my life.</p>\n\n<p>A similar thing happened soon after this when I was at my sister&#39;s\nhome\nand I saw an image of my toddling nephew falling down the stairs. His\nmother and my sister were both standing close to him so I assumed they\nwere watching him. I was on the other side of the room. He fell\npartially down the carpeted stairs and was okay, but I wasn&#39;t. I was\nshook up that the responsibility was on me to save the children because\nI saw it and the parents didn&#39;t and to keep my mouth shut so as not to\nembarrass them (or myself).</p>\n\n<p>Some premonitions and events have actually been humorous. I dreamed\nabout a friend&#39;s pregnancy in another city before she even knew she was\npregnant. Funny thing&ndash;in the dream she was craving chicken so a mutual\nfriend and I were driving around in the middle of the night trying to\nfind an open chicken restaurant and we were all vegetarian! I told her\nand she denied she was pregnant. Her daughter is four years old now.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever forgotten to turn off the stove and come home hours later\nto find the food and the pot safe as if time has been put on hold? If\nI&#39;d been at home it would have been hopelessly burnt for sure! Just\ncurious if this is common. This has happened to me several times.</p>\n\n<p>There have also been several deja vu experiences such as having a dream\nor a flash of an image and then several years later being in the place\nseen previously even though I&#39;d never been there or even heard of it.\nSome occurred way across the USA or the world! Often the dreams were\nforgotten about as insignificant and then later I recognized the exact\nwords spoken and the previously unknown people. It&#39;s embarrassing to be\nstaring in awe as the recognition sinks in with tears streaming down\nyour cheeks in a room full of people. And you can&#39;t explain that you\nnow know you have made the right decision to take the risk to get there.</p>\n\n<p>One consolation has been an image of a field of flowers, mostly red,\nwhich instantly fills me with an incredible feeling of peace and\nrelaxation. It is the only memory of the near-death experience itself,\nother than looking down on my body. Since the NDE I&#39;ve been on what\nseems like a never-ending search for that incredible peace and\nunconditional love on earth. The closest I have come to it was learning\nmeditation when I see very vividly colored fields of flowers and feel\nthe peace again.</p>\n\n<p>## Fourteenth to Twentieth Years:</p>\n\n<p>These recent years have been quieter in terms of psychic and physical\nchanges, perhaps because I have integrated them into my life as more\nnormal. My allergies and sensitivities to light and noise is less. The\nmost significant development has been my ability to relate to people\ninstead of withdrawing from them because I didn&#39;t know how to handle\nthe vivid visual or dream information I would get about them.</p>\n\n<p>However some life changes since 1994 have been unsettling and\nchallenging. Some of this time has been wonderful and I have felt whole\nand fulfilled better than I ever can remember. But the years leading up\nto this and since then have been rough. I questioned my life purpose and\ndirection. Was I going backwards or forwards?</p>\n\n<p>At PMH Atwater&#39;s workshop in September, 2000, she gave us a handout\nwith the Brain Shift Phases of Integration Most Experiencers Go Through.\nI read Phase Four and gasped. But the above details from her book\nChildren of the New Millennium really explains much more and hits home.\nI cried when I read it because it explains so much of what I have been\nthrough.</p>\n\n<p>I attempted suicide last year for the first time. Prior to this I had\nalways rationalized myself out of it. To most people it would not have\nlooked like suicide. It just would have looked like heatstroke because I\nchose not to open a window or turn a fan on. I don&#39;t know if it was\npossible for me to even die that way. But it is interesting that I had\nan abnormal cardiac stress test earlier that month before the suicide\nattempt. I had already given my body a &ldquo;die message.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>1999 was hell! It started January 1999 and ended December 31st. I lost\nmy health, had no income, became homeless, lost all my friends, moved to\na foreign side of town. Then doctors, public aid and other social\nagencies refused to help. I had made major sacrifices with following my\nintuition/greater plan and then it seems that I had lost everything! In\nSeptember 1999 I almost died from a simple unidentified infection. What\na way to have to let go of all the false roles and identities I had.\nTalk about major transition! It was either sink or swim.</p>\n\n<p>Reading Children of the New Millennium has been a blessing for me. Why\nis it that I usually get explanations after I have already been through\nthe worst of it? Imagine how I felt when I read the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&quot;Somewhere between the twelfth and fourteenth years and, maybe up to\nthe twentieth, there is another marker--a second birthday--and it\ncatches most experiencers unaware.

17	The Induction of After-Death Communications Utilizing EMDR	Allan L Botkin, Psy.D.	ABSTRACT: A number of authors have described after-death communications (ADCs), in which bereaved individuals believe is actual spiritual contact with the deceased. ADC's are consistently reported as profoundly loving experiences that greatly assist the grieving process. Although most researchers have argued that ADCs can occur only spontaneously, Raymond Moody's research has indicated that we do have some control over the production of the experience. In this paper, I describe a new induction technique that produces ADCs in a more elaborated experience that often fosters complete resolution of grief. These induced ADCs also appear to be much more like near-death experiences (NDEs) than do spontaneous ADCs, which strongly suggests that NDEs and ADCs may be essentially the same phenomenon.\r\n\r\nSince earning my Doctor of Psychology degree from Baylor University in 1983, I have worked in private practice and on a specialized inpatient psychiatric trauma unit. My area of specialty has been the diagnosis and treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and grief. About two years ago, I began to use a relatively new and very powerful psychological treatment in a different way. My intent was simply to make an already very powerful method more efficient. However, something very strange began to happen. A good number of my patients reported to me that they had actually made spiritual contract with the deceased person they were grieving. Moreover, when patients had this kind of experience, their grief suddenly and completely resolved. I immediately became curious about whatever it was that was producing these experiences. I retraced the steps taken in each case the experience occurred, as well as in each case the experience did not occur. I was able to identify the essential psychotherapeutic components that produced the experience. By combining these components and further refining the procedure, I discovered that I could induce the experience in nearly all of my patients.\r\n\r\nThis kind of experience is not rare for people who grieve, and they have been recorded throughout history. The phenomenon has been recently described by a few authors who have either conducted surveys, or worked directly with grieving patients. The experience is now commonly referred to as an "after-death communication," or ADC. However, the current thinking in the field is that ADCs are always spontaneous, and cannot be willfully or purposefully produced. In fact, one author speculated that we will never be to induce ADCs (LaGrand, 1997). The current belief is that some people are just fortunate enough to have an ADC and experience its therapeutic benefits, while others, for some unknown reason, are not.\r\n\r\n# Spontaneous ADCs\r\n\r\nAt least four books have been recently published on ADCs. The first of these was *Hello From Heaven!* (1996), by Bill and Judy Guggenheim. They presented the results of an extensive survey of generally normal and healthy individuals who reported spontaneous spiritual encounters with deceased friends and loved ones. They labeled these experiences "after-death communications," or ADCs. The authors collected first hand accounts of ADCs from 2,000 people. They estimated that as many as 20 percent of the population in the United States have experienced ADCs. Since an estimated 4 percent of the population has experienced near-death experiences (NDEs), the occurrence of ADCs is about five times greater than that of NDEs. The percentage of ADCs for parents who have lost children to death and for widows is even higher.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable aspect of this survey, for me, was that the 353 personal accounts of ADCs reported in the book were identical in many ways to the experiences my patients have been reporting to me, both in terms of the content of the experience and its overwhelmingly positive psychological consequences. I was immediately convinced that, in essence, we were dealing with the same phenomenon. One major difference, however, is that the Guggenheims made the argument that ADCs can only occur spontaneously, and that they cannot be purposefully produced. Other ADC researchers generally make the same claim.\r\n\r\nThe Guggenheims described 12 types of spontaneous ADCs: sentient ADCs, one of the most common types, involve sensing or feeling the presence of the deceased; auditory ADCs, also common, involving hearing the voice of the deceased or receiving a verbal message; tactile ADCs, involving feeling a physical touch by the deceased; olfactory ADCs, involving smelling a fragrance that is associated with the deceased; visual ADCs involving seeing the deceased; ADC visions that include some form of two-way telepathic communication, distinguished from visual ADCs in that they involve "bright, vivid colors, that radiate their own inner light"; twilight ADCs, occurring just as people are falling asleep or waking up; sleep-state ADCs, occurring when a person is asleep, but experienced as very different from dreams; out-of-body ADCs, involving contact with the deceased while the survivor is in an out-of-body state, which may be comparable to NDEs and include going through a tunnel and towards a light before meeting the deceased; telephone ADCs, the least common form of ADC, in which people have reported actually receiving a phone call from the deceased when awake; ADCs of physical phenomena, involving unusual physical events perceived as a message from the deceased, such as a light being turned on or off, or a door being opened or closed; and symbolic ADCs, involving something in the physical environment that survivors interpret as a sign from the deceased, such as butterflies or rainbows.\r\n\r\nThe experiential quality and content of the various sensory components of spontaneous and induced ADCs are essentially identical. People who have had either a spontaneous or an induced ADC describe the sensory components of their experience in the same way. All indications are that the two are the same phenomenon. There is, however, one major difference. Induced ADCs, as opposed to spontaneous ADCs, are almost always multi-sensory in nature, and typically involve at least the visual and auditory components, and frequently the radiant quality of the ADC vision as well. The tactile and the olfactory components are also sometimes reported in induced ADCs. The NDE-like qualities of some out-of-body ADCs are also included in many induced ADCs; however, none of my patients ever reported an out-of-body experience concurrent with his or her ADC. It appears that, in general, that the more multi-sensory and elaborated ADCs are, the more similar they are to NDEs. That is why induced ADCs are actually more similar to NDEs, than to spontaneous ADCs. This also appears to explain why spontaneous ADC researchers have apparently not considered ADCs and NDEs to be the same phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe reason that induced ADCs are more multi-sensory and elaborated is that the induction procedure allows much greater control of the experience, both in terms of initiating the experience and developing the different aspects of it. The main reason this difference is important is that increased control and elaboration clearly enhances the therapeutic value of the experience, which is consistent with my reading of the available case material. To offer an analogy, in many cases, the spontaneous ADC is like recognizing an old friend by chance passing in a car going the opposite direction on a highway, whereas the induced ADC is like driving to your friend's house so you can sit down and talk for a while.\r\n\r\nI am also not convinced that all 12 types of spontaneous ADCs listed above are true ADCs, which are clearly identifiable by their universal quality and content. It appears that some of the above categories of spontaneous ADCs are very different in this respect, and could possibly be explained by known psychological mechanisms. I am not arguing that some of these experiences are not of therapeutic value, but only that they may be a different phenomenon. "Sensing" the presence of the deceased, for example, may be very comforting, but it could simply be an activation of the memory of what it felt like to be with the deceased before death. Twilight ADCs may be simply hypnagogic or hypnopompic phenomena. ADCs of physical phenomena and symbolic ADCS, which also do not involve a direct sensory experience, may have more to do with the healing powers of imagination or intuition. With ADC inductions, these experiences would only be a starting point, in terms of creating a receptive mode, so that a direct and fully elaborated multi-sensory experience can occur, which will not just assist the survivor in the grieving process, but most likely provide complete resolution.\r\n\r\nSince the Guggenheims published the results of their survey, three other books on spontaneous ADCs have been published by different authors. Edie Devers, a practicing psychotherapist, published *Goodbye Again* in 1997, based upon her research for her M.S.N. and Ph.D. degrees. As the other books described here on spontaneous ADCs, she provided actual case material that illustrated the loving content of ADCs and the personal convictions of experiencers in the spiritual reality of ADCs. Devers believes, as I do, that the therapeutic value of ADCs is due to establishing the feeling of reconnection with the deceased.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the psychological state necessary to experience an ADC she wrote:\r\n\r\n> Most who have had ADC believe that certain states of consciousness are more conducive to it than others...Some people believe that being in a state of quiet is the only way to experience the deceased. Others said that because they were so exhausted physically and emotionally by grief, their defenses were down; thus they were in a receptive state to experience the deceased...Others believe that one only needs to be receptive to the idea of ADC to be capable of experiencing it. (Devers, 1997, pp. 19-21)\r\n\r\nDevers continued:\r\n\r\n> However, having a receptive mind-set does not guarantee an experience for everyone. Some people who want to have experiences do not have them, and others have them, unexpectedly. In most cases the experience is initiated by the deceased...People who try to contact the deceased are generally unsuccessful. (1997, p. 22)\r\n\r\nDevers reported that not all experiencers are immediately helped by an ADC, and that for some, ADCs leave people with a negative feeling because they either reexperience an old conflict with the deceased, or because they feel they lose the deceased all over again when the ADC ends. Devers also pointed out that "Though [ADC] communication is usually brief and simple, it can be complicated and ongoing. When it is extended, it often not only leads to grief resolution but also helps heal the relationship between the living and deceased" (1997, p. 29). Thus, because of the brief nature of many spontaneous ADCs, sometimes not only is resolution not possible, they can at times intensify the unresolved negative feelings associated with the loss.\r\n\r\nI believe that Devers correctly identified the receptive mode as the psychological state necessary to achieve an ADC. The only ingredient missing here is a method to increase or maximize the receptive mode. Of course, that is exactly what my induction technique provides. Also, because of the reliability and control in ADC inductions, all induced ADC experiences can be rather easily extended and elaborated, thereby allowing resolution of all grief and relationship issues.\r\n\r\nAlexandra Kennedy published *Your Loved On Lives On Within You* in 1997. Kennedy focused on the problem of unfinished business for the bereaved that frequently accompanies unresolved grief. Although her goal was to help people establish a reconnection to deceased loved ones, she did so by helping survivors develop their powers of imagination. By strengthening imaginational skills and focusing on the deceased through such techniques as internal communication, letter writing, dialogue, and imagery, the bereaved are assisted in working through a variety of unresolved issues. Whether these experiences are actual contacts with dead is less an issue for Kennedy than helping those who suffer. She purposefully did not attempt to make a distinction between purely psychological products of imagination and the more universal content of ADC experiences. Some of the experiences of her clients are suggestive of true ADCs, while others are clearly products of imagination. For example, she instructed her clients to carry on internal conversations not only with the deceased, which sometimes triggers an ADC, but also with living family members and friends. Although internal conversations in general appear to be psycho-therapeutically helpful, they tend to be highly individualized and do not offer the sudden and dramatic psychotherapeutic shifts of true ADCs. ADCs that do occur in the course of Kennedy's treatment were therefore somewhat inadvertent, which makes it significantly different from the approach to ADC induction described below.\r\n\r\nAnother recently published book, *After-Death Communication: Final Farewells* (1997) was written by Louis LaGrand, A Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the State University of New York. His conclusions were based upon 15 years of experience with the bereaved, and generally support the findings of Guggenheim and Guggenheim. LaGrand, as many other professionals who have worked closely with grieving patients, appears to have come to believe in the spiritual authenticity of ADCs, and made a strong argument for his case.\r\n\r\nLaGrand began his analysis of ADCs by stating: "It is important to emphasize that the living person is not actively seeking to make contact with the deceased...Instead it is the deceased...who seems to reach out" (1997, p. xiii). LaGrand later in his book offered some speculation as to why all mourners do not experience ADCs. He wrote:\r\n\r\n> What I am getting at is that it may well be impossible to obtain scientific evidence to say unequivocally that the contact experience is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, true. Unfortunately, but undeniably, the evasiveness of the contact experience is another reason mainstream scientists have shunned investigation of the phenomena. Who is ever going to pull off an apparition in a laboratory setting? Who will be able to obtain the cooperation of a deceased husband to talk to his widow with researchers standing by in white coats with pencils poised?...I regret to say at this time that such a demand cannot be met, and probably never will be. (1997, p. 164).\r\n\r\nIt will be clear below that LaGrand's beliefs about the importance of who initiates the contact, and his related pessimism about the possibility of scientific study, are no longer warranted.\r\n\r\nIn summary, then, these authors, who have had considerable experience in working with or researching individuals who have had spontaneous ADCs, come to some similar conclusions. They uniformly recognize, for example, that spontaneous ADCs significantly assist survivors in the grieving process. Yet, the process or mechanism that produces the spontaneous ADC is viewed as either a matter of speculation, or as even beyond what is knowable. It should be clearly pointed out, however, that I am not the first to induce ADCs with any consistent success. Raymond Moody began experimentation with inducing ADCs some years ago and wrote a book on the topic a few years before these more recent books on spontaneous ADCs were published.\r\n\r\n# Moody's Induced ADCs\r\n\r\nIn 1992, Moody published a report in this Journal, followed by his book *Reunions* in 1993, in which he described the experiences that subjects in his study had with departed loved ones. He induced ADCs in his subjects by utilizing the method of mirror gazing, which was developed by the ancient Greeks. In his initial study, he gathered ten emotionally healthy, professional people. Moody spent nearly an entire day with each subject individually, generally talking about the departed loved one and assisting the subject in getting into a relaxed state. At dusk the subject would sit in front of a mirrors in a setting designed to promote the experience. Of the ten subjects, five experienced ADCs. Moody reported that he has been able to increase the odds of inducing ADCs since his original study, but he did not provide any additional numbers.\r\n\r\nMoody therefore demonstrated that not all ADCs are purely spontaneous, and that we do have some control over their production. I strongly suspect, however, that the mirror gazing itself had less to do with the production of ADCs in his study, than did his rather involved and prolonged preparation for the experience, which assisted his subjects in achieving a relaxed and receptive state. It would not be surprising if a number of different induction procedures would work if a person were in the right frame of mind. After all, ADCs occur spontaneously under a variety of circumstances, when a person quite by chance happens to be in the appropriate receptive mode.\r\n\r\nThe main advantages of using the induction procedure described below are that it is faster, more efficient, and more under the control of both the therapist and the experiencer. It is faster because this technique has the power to induce rapidly the psychological state necessary to achieve the experience; it literally takes only a few minutes. Also, the success rate of the method provided here is 98 percent for first attempts, which points to the greater efficiency of this method. It offers greater control of the experience because if certain issues are left unaddressed and unresolved after an initial ADC, which happens rather frequently, it is a simple matter to induce the experience again and proceed until all issues are sufficiently resolved.\r\n\r\n# The Discovery of the Induction Technique\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most startling aspect of the discovery presented here is that these experiences are actually rather easy to produce. It does not matter if the loss is traumatic, such as the death of a child or battlefield buddy, or if the death is the more usual variety, such as the death of a grandparent. It does not matter if the death was recent, or if it occurred many decades in the past. It also does not matter what a person's religious or spiritual beliefs are prior to the experience. It works for people with deep religious convictions and atheists as well. In fact, it appears to work for anyone who is willing and able to participate in the procedure, and individual factors beyond that seem to be of no consequence. Also, interested colleagues have been able to achieve nearly identical results after being provided some instruction. In short, the technique appears to be very robust and the outcomes do not appear to be restricted by any identifiable patient or therapist variables.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of losing a friend, comrade, or loved one is the deep and painful felling of loss or disconnection. The goal of current grief therapies is to help survivors achieve a level of acceptance of the loss that allows them to move on and learn to enjoy life, in spite of some continuing pain. The prevailing belief among grief therapists is that grief is never fully resolved. The approach to treating grief, which is provided here, is radically different. The goal with ADC inductions is psychological reconnection and resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest, but not necessarily least profound of these induced ADC experiences, the individual "sees" the deceased as happy and at peace, and still very much alive, although in a different place. Usually some form of communication also occurs. As a result of the experience, the pain of disconnection vanishes, and is replaced by a loving reconnection. The experience dramatically erases any doubts about a belief in an afterlife. Just as people who have and a near-death experience (NDE) no longer believe death is final, people who experience an ADC no longer believe their friend or loved one is really gone. Grief work from this perspective, therefore, is not a matter of saying good-bye, but hello.\r\n\r\n## General Considerations in the Standard Treatment of Grief\r\n\r\nGrief is a very individual process that involves a variety of psychological reactions to the perception of loss. It is a natural and spontaneous response, and typically a wide variety of emotions are involved, most prominent of which are feelings of loss, guilt, and anger. Mourning involves the sharing of the feelings of grief with others, and therefore involves the social and cultural meaning of the loss. Bereavement is the objective state of having suffered a loss.\r\n\r\nPost-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, develops from an exposure to an event that involved either actual or threatened death, physical injury, or violation of physical integrity. The three clusters of symptoms are the re-experiencing of the traumatic event, such as intrusive recollections, nightmares, and feelings of reliving the event through flashbacks; the persistent avoidance of reminders of the incident; and the persistent feelings of increased physiological arousal.\r\n\r\nGrief and PTSD are similar in some very important ways. The core issue of both grief and PTSD is loss, although in either case, the loss does not necessarily involve a death. In situations of overwhelming threat in which no death occurred, for example, the core issue of PTSD is often the loss of a sense of invulnerability to harm. Grief can be associated with any loss, such as loss of a job or a marriage. In this paper, induction procedure I describe is not appropriate for cases of grief and PTSD that do not involve a death. Since the core issues and dynamics of grief and PTSD are nearly identical when a death is involved, I make no further diagnostic distinctions between the two here. However, it should be made clear that PTSD is a complex disorder, and although ADC inductions provide resolution of feelings of loss, guilt, anger, and directly related intrusive symptoms, just as they do with grief, they have less of an impact on other symptoms, such as those associated with avoidance and physiological arousal. This is especially true of cases in which the PTSD is chronic and involve multiple traumas. Therefore, although ADC inductions address the most painful aspect of trauma when a death is involved, they are not appropriate for all traumas, and they do not directly address all of the PTSD symptoms, even when death is the primary issue.\r\n\r\nGrief is a very individual matter, and is influenced by such factors as the age of both the deceased and the survivor, the survivor's support system, the survivor's relationship to the deceased, and the cause of death. Moreover, grief usually never fully resolves. Most grief counselors would agree that it generally takes people from one to two years to reconcile a loss to the degree that they can again find enjoyment in a life without their loved one. It takes even longer than that in cases which involve the death of a child or a spouse after many years of marriage. Moreover, reminders of the loss can continue to trigger any unresolved aspects of grief for a lifetime. The primary emotional components of grief are generally recognized as the feelings of loss, guilt, and anger.\r\n\r\nThe bond between the living is love, but when a loved one dies, the bond is pain. Helping a client work through the pain and achieve acceptance is complicated by guilt and fears of complete disconnection with the deceased. Guilt can also be associated with a wide variety of issues, but most commonly for having "unfinished business" with the deceased. Examples of unfinished business include never having said "I love you," having unresolved interpersonal difficulties with the deceased, or feeling responsible in some way for the death of the deceased. Generally, those who grieve also feel intense anger, because someone very important has been taken away. Both guilt and anger can be related to issues of blame and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal in standard grief therapy, therefore, is to help survivors achieve a level of acceptance of their loss that allows them to learn to enjoy life again, in spite of these ongoing difficulties. The approach provided her is radically different from this perspective. The psychotherapeutic procedure that I will describe below, instead of promoting acceptance of the perceived disconnection, actually provides complete psychological resolution through establishing an experiential reconnection with the deceased.\r\n\r\n## Some Insights and Breakthroughs\r\n\r\nPeople who experience normal grief, and especially those who suffer a traumatic loss, generally experience a variety of intense emotions. Feelings frequently vacillate between anger, guilt, and deep sadness or loss. A person who grieves, for example, may be crying one moment, and full of anger of even rage the next. A large portion of the job of a psychotherapist is to provide a supportive psychological environment in which these feelings can be openly expressed. Patients are told that these feelings are completely normal and they are encouraged to express them. By working through or processing these feelings, patients are usually able eventually to achieve some level of acceptance of their loss and an improved capacity to get on with their lives. Generally, however, the loss is never fully resolved, and stimuli or reminders of the loss can trigger periods of sadness, guilt, or anger for a lifetime. Over time these episodes usually decrease somewhat in both frequency and intensity.\r\n\r\nI have learned some important lessons over the years while treating people who suffer from loss. One insight is that feelings generally come in layers, or in a predictable order, both in terms of psychological importance and a patient's readiness to address them. Attributions of blame and responsibility, which are related to feelings of guilt and anger, can be very important from a legal point of view, but psychologically, these issues are peripheral to the core and more painful feelings of loss. Some level of acceptance can be achieved only when the feelings of loss are worked through to some degree. In psychotherapy, therefore, the expression of feelings of guilt and anger should be encouraged, so they can be processed or worked through, which in turn allows the issue of loss to be directly addressed.\r\n\r\nThis was the general state of the art of grief work, with some of my own clinical insights included, when a major breakthrough in psychological treatment was discovered in the late 1980's by Francine Shapiro, who, while walking through a park one day and feeling upset about some troubling and recurring thoughts, found herself spontaneously shifting her eyes back and forth. She noticed that the shifting of her eyes greatly reduced the negative emotional charge and intrusive nature of her thoughts. She then tried the technique on friends and colleagues, and surprisingly, got the same results. She went on to conduct controlled scientific studies on subjects diagnosed with PTSD, and found that the technique produced psychotherapeutic outcomes unprecedented in the field of mental health.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues and I, who had been treating patients with PTSD for many years, were initially very skeptical about what appeared to be a very simplistic procedure that produced such unbelievable psychotherapeutic results. We were open-minded enough, however, to at least give it a try. I will never forget our first application of the new procedure. One of our PTSD patients, who had been in ongoing psychotherapy with us for over three years, have us informed consent to attempt the new and experimental procedure. With myself and another psychologist observing, our colleague accomplished in 30 minutes what the patient had been unable to do in three years. It was as if somebody had just turned on a light bulb for the first time. For the next few years, psychologists across the country, myself included, began to publish scientific studies in mainstream psychological journals which supported Shapiro's findings (Lipke and Botkin, 1992). The technique is now known as eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR.\r\n\r\nThe EMDR technique involves getting the patient to move his or her eyes in a particular rhythmic fashion while at the same time attending to a particular aspect of the traumatic memory. The therapeutic results, to those familiar with the treatment of PTSD and grief, are nothing less than astonishing. For many patients, significant desensitization of t he intrusive images and feelings associated with a particular loss can occur within a single session. Similarly, EMDR also results in a rapid cognitive restructuring of the traumatic event. We are thus in many instances able to achieve in one session of EMDR what we had been unable to accomplish after years of traditional psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nHow EMDR works is still a matter of some debate. However, most psychologists familiar with the procedure would agree that it somehow greatly increases the brain's ability to process information. Shapiro's "Accelerated Information Processing" model is consistent with clinical observations. It has been known for some time that the shifting of the eyes is associated with increased brain processing. The most familiar example is that of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which occurs when we dream. It is generally agreed that the increased processing that occurs during dreaming causes the eyes to shift back and forth. With EMDR it appears that the reverse is also true, that a purposeful shifting of the eyes causes an increase in the brain's ability to process information.\r\n\r\nSince one can literally accomplish in a single session with EMDR what used to take years with more traditional therapies, some rather amazing events began to occur in my psychotherapy sessions. I found, for example, that EMDR allowed such a rapid processing through the layers of anger and guilt, that patients were frequently ready to access their feelings of loss in the first session. But even more than that, I found that if the patient could access the feeling of loss, to any degree and at any time, in spite of concurrent feelings of anger and guilt, and focus on it with EMDR a clinically significant level of acceptance was imminent. When the feeling of loss is rapidly processed in this manner with EMDR, one will also usually find that all of the associated anger and guilt have vanished, without even being directly addressed. This clinical observation supports the hypothesis that anger and guilt serve a protective or defensive function against the more painful feelings of loss. When the loss is directly and successfully processed, and some level of acceptance is achieved, there is simply little reason for the patient to continue to feel anger or guilt.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts in mind, I began to use EMDR in an even more focused way on the core issue of loss. When I did, something else very unusual began to occur. Some of my patients reported that during EMDR they made what they believed to be a spiritual connection to the deceased person they were grieving. But even more than that, they also claimed that they "saw" and "talked to" their deceased friend or loved one! Remarkably, whenever this occurred, not only did the patients immediately achieve a significant level of acceptance of the loss, they in nearly all cases also experienced a complete resolution of the loss, and all related symptoms, such as anger, guilt, and intrusive images. Many patients literally began the session in despair, and left feeling joyous. At first I believed that the EMDR had produced some sort of hallucinatory event, and that the results would not last. However, my attempts to obtain follow-up data indicated that the results did indeed last, and in fact, the results appeared to hold up over time in every case. Other clinicians have reported the production of similar spontaneous ADCs during standard EMDR treatment, with similar therapeutic results (Parnell, 1996).\r\n\r\nAfter these experiences occurred a number of times in a more or less unexpected fashion, I wanted to understand why it was that some of my patients had this experience, while others did not. I went back and examined each case in which the experience occurred, and each case in which it did not. I was then able to discern a particular sequence of psychotherapeutic eents that led to the experience. When I then applied these principles with other patients, I found that it appeared that I could induce the experience in all of them. The most remarkable aspect of this whole endeavor was that I found that it was actually very easy to do.\r\n\r\n# ADC Induction Procedure\r\n\r\nIt is important to emphasize to the reader that one must already be trained in EMDR in order to be able to use the ADC induction technique described here. For mental health professionals to obtain a "certificate of completion," they must successfully complete Shapiro's level I and level II workshops. All mental health professionals recognized by state or federal licensing authorities as independent providers of mental health services are eligible for EMDR training.\r\n\r\nShapiro has created some controversy in the field by maintaining strict control over the teaching of EMDR. Mental health professionals can learn the technique only by attending her two officially sanctioned workshops, which are now provided on a regular basis throughout the United States and in a few other countries. She has proceeded in this manner because EMDR is so powerful that misuse and harm to patients is a real possibility. I received both level I and level II training several years ago, and have served as a facilitator at her workshops.\r\n\r\nClearly, all clients or patients considered for an ADC induction should be thoroughly screened. Although I never had a patient who got worse as a result of an ADC induction, the possibility certainly exists. Theoretically, an ADC could trigger a psychotic reaction in those with a history of severe mental disorders. The most important consideration in screening patients is the potential adverse reaction to EMDR. Psychological decompensation could occur in those with a history of severe abuse. As any adequately trained EMDR therapist is aware, there exists the possibility of inadvertently uncovering repressed or partially repressed traumatic material. A good history is therefore essential. Current factors I routinely assess are overall psychological health, concurrent stressors, medications, substance abuse, suicide potential, and available social and professional support systems.\r\n\r\nA good psychotherapeutic relationship is essential, as are warmth, empathy, and genuineness on the part of the therapist. It simply will not work if the patient does not trust the therapist and withholds valuable information. Prior to the induction, it is important that the patient talk about his or her relationship to the deceased and the circumstances of the death. This not only assists the patient in achieving an appropriate focus, it also alerts the therapist to the potential issues that might arise during the induction. The therapist also needs to be aware of how the ADC is unfolding, so that the experience can be properly guided.\r\n\r\nWhen inducing ADCs, it is important to keep the principles described in the prior section in mind. It is also my belief, that in any application of EMDR, that the psychotherapeutic process proceeds much more efficiently if the most distressing issue is addressed first. If the memory with the greatest emotional charge is not addressed first, it can unexpectedly intrude into consciousness while one is attempting to deal with a memory that is less emotionally charged. When this occurs, no further progress can be achieved unless the more distressing memory is addressed with EMDR. If the patient is unwilling to address the more distressing memory, then all progress is halted, and the patient frequently feels worse as a result of uncovering two memories, for which further working through is no longer possible. I therefore routinely have patients rank order their issues prior to the application of EMDR. I have found that this allows psychotherapy to proceed more efficiently, more rapidly, and with fewer complications.\r\n\r\nInducing ADCs works better when there is a cooperative effort between therapist and patient. Some of my colleagues, when they first attempted to induce ADCs and were unsure of the technique and their own skills, introduced the procedure to their patient in a subtle fashion. Risk of failure was therefore avoided because the patient was not quite sure what the therapist was trying to do. With this approach ADCs did occur, but the results were variable. I begin, therefore, in setting up a cooperative endeavor by explaining the procedure and inquiring about the patient's religious or spiritual beliefs.\r\n\r\nFor patients who do not believe in an afterlife, I ask them simply whether they believe that an afterlife is even possible. Since almost all patients will admit that there is no way to know for sure, the procedure is then offered as a cooperative experiment. The expectation that the procedure may not work appears to have no effect on the production of the experience. The patient needs only to be willing to give it a try. If the patient professes a belief in an afterlife, a different route is taken. Although these patients might initially see some potential value in the procedure, it is essential that they be instructed not to project their own beliefs into the experience. Sometimes patients need to be reminded of this more than once during the course of the ADC induction. Since ADCs appear to be universal experiences, and unrelated to a patient's particular beliefs, any attempts by the patient to create an experience consistent with his or her religious beliefs will prevent an ADC from occurring. Some patients, for example, expect to see the deceased burning in hell or floating around in the clouds in a spiritual body. In such cases, the production of an ADC is blocked and essentially nothing happens. Therefore, whether the patient has religious beliefs or not, the critical factor in ADC inductions is that the patient is open to the experience, and in a receptive mode. I sometimes tell my patients to let the deceased do the work of finding them, and that their only job is to "open the door" to let them in.\r\n\r\nPrior to the first set of EMDR, patients are instructed that they are to think about where their deceased friend or loved one is right now, while at the same time receiving the first set of EMDR. I use the phrase "right now" in order to discourage the patient from attempting to bring up a memory of the deceased, which is a rather common tendency. At the same time, I encourage the patient not to attempt to create the experience but just to be open to whatever happens. My co-therapist presents the technique in a more neutral manner by simply instructing the patient to "hold the thought" of the deceased person while receiving EMDR. The advantage of this approach is that it decreases patients' attempts to project an expectation of "where" the deceased is "right now". However, this approach also increases the likelihood of the patient bringing up a memory of the deceased. Both approaches seem to work equally well, and these minor differences therefore appear to be of no consequence. My co-therapist's technique provides a better argument that the patient's experience is not influenced by the therapist's suggestion. However, I continue to use my approach for reasons of clinical expediency. In either case, whether the patient attempts to construct the experience, or bring up a memory, it is almost always sufficient simply to remind the patient to put his or her expectations on hold, and just go with the experience.\r\n\r\nPatients are also instructed beforehand to close their eyes for a period of time following each set of EMDR in order to allow the experience to unfold. They are also told, however, that if a negative intrusion occurs, such as a bloody scene or an image of the deceased in a casket, they are to open their eyes and inform the therapist. Besides expectations and projected beliefs, negative intrusions can also block the ADC experience. Intrusions can take many forms besides distressing images, such as negative feelings or thoughts, or uncomfortable physical sensations. If intrusions occur, the therapist simply applies EMDR to whatever is intruding, and an ADC induction is attempted again. Intrusions do not have to be desensitized completely, but only enough to allow the ADC to develop, because once an ADC is achieved, all associated negative symptoms generally disappear. It is important to point out that if the patient's loss is traumatic and severe intrusive symptoms are part of the overall clinical picture, it is better to desensitize these intrusive symptoms to some degree before attempting the induction. If the intrusions are mild to moderate, the therapist can go ahead and attempt an ADC induction, and provide EMDR on any intrusions that arise during the course of induction.\r\n\r\nFrequently not all issues associated with the loss are resolved with a single ADC induction. For this reason, it is essential to evaluate the patient after each experience. If an issue is left unresolved simply instruct the patient to bring that issue ("to have it in mind") and induce another ADC. It is important, however, that the patient maintain a receptive mode and not attempt to recreate the image he or she had in the preceding ADC.\r\n\r\nPatients are generally surprised, and even somewhat shocked, by their ADC experience. In my experience this has never been a very serious issue and most people readily change their beliefs to assimilate their experience. In fact, nearly all patients seem to like their new way of thinking more than the old. Nevertheless, some time should be taken to evaluate this aspect, and to assist patients in framing their experience in any way that is comfortable for them.\r\n\r\n## Additional Clinical Observations\r\n\r\nAlthough the following are not frequently observed during ADC inductions, they occur with enough regularity to merit some attention. First, although going through a tunnel or passageway and towards light is one of the universal elements of the experience, it is at times associated with the patient not being fully relaxed, usually because the patient is trying too hard. If the patient experiences some frustration getting though the tunnel, inquire whether the patient is indeed feeling this way, provide a set of EMDR to promote relaxation, an then induce the ADC again. Frequently, the patient will then immediately experience the deceased. In general, any time the patient appears to be trying too hard and is unable to achieve an ADC, it is helpful to use a paradoxical approach by instructing the patient not to attempt an ADC during a set of eye movements, but just to focus on relaxation. An ADC frequently then develops because the patient gives up his or her attempts to create the experience, which then allows the ADC to occur naturally.\r\n\r\nSecond, the ADC experience typically lasts only as long as it needs to from a psychological point of view. When all issues have been resolved, sometimes patients want to linger in the experience, but these patients frequently report that the experience rapidly fades. It can be supportive to point out to these patients that this is a common experience. Usually this is only a minor issue because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the experience that has just ensued.\r\n\r\nThird, a few patients have expressed a concern prior to the experience that the deceased, for whatever reason, will be seen in hell. Again, simply instruct the patient to withhold all expectations about the experience. No one has yet reported a hellish scene. It is also interesting to note that even when the deceased did clearly live a life of low moral character, which has even included murder, they are nevertheless experienced as peaceful and happy, as having learned from their mistakes, and as having taken responsibility for their actions. They are also experienced as concerned about whatever pain or suffering they caused other people in life. The issue of unfinished business then, is experienced by survivors as important to the deceased as well.\r\n\r\nFourth, when I first began doing ADC inductions, I was somewhat surprised that a successful ADC induction with the death of one person did not seem to generalize to other deaths. Even though ADC experiencers, in almost all cases, are subsequently convinced of the reality of an afterlife, a successful resolution appears to have little or no effect on the grief associated with other losses. This observation suggests that it is the experience itself, and not any subsequent changes in beliefs, that is responsible for psychological resolution. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that even those who do not believe in the spiritual authenticity of their experience, nevertheless report full resolution of grief.\r\n\r\n# Data Summary\r\n\r\nOut of 84 patients for whom an ADC induction was offered, 83 (99%) were willing to participate in an induction. Of the 83 patients who participated in an induction. Of the 83 patients who participated in an ADC induction, 81 (98%) achieved an ADC, defined as any perceived sensory contact with the deceased. Of the 81 patients who achieved an ADC, 78 (96%) reported full resolution of grief following the ADC, and 76 (94%) believed their ADC was an actual spiritual contact. Of those 76 patients who believed their ADC was an actual spiritual contact, only 6 (8%) had believed prior to the ADC that actual contact was possible.\r\n\r\nThis summary is based upon the first 84 patients to whom I offered an ADC induction. Although an overwhelming majority of patients who achieved an ADC chose to do additional ADCs with other deceased individuals, only first attempts are represented here. The total number of all ADC inductions I was involved in, including a few conducted by my co-therapist, whom I supervised, exceeds 400. In general, ADCs become even easier to induce with practice. It is clear from these numbers that patients or clients are very willing to attempt an induction for the first time, even though they generally believe beforehand that such an experience is not possible. This, of course, depends upon the trust your patient has in your ability as a therapist and his or her willingness to try something different, something that might even sound a little "crazy" at first. If your patient is then willing and able to participate in the procedure, an ADC will usually occur. It is also clear that people ho experience induced ADCs, in almost all cases, believe that their experience was actual contact with the deceased. The foregoing was the only information I recorded on a regular basis, other than the verbal reports of my patients. Although I initially had some interest in the potential effects of varying prior belief systems on ADC induction outcomes, I did not keep a record of those data. However, I have worked with many patients who described themselves as atheists, many who were unsure about their beliefs, and many who professed strong religious convictions. The fact that 98 percent of patients achieve ADCs no matter what they believe, as long they are able and willing to participate in the procedure, strongly suggests that the difference in subjects' prior beliefs systems is of little consequence.\r\n\r\n# Cases\r\n\r\nI provide here brief summaries of a few actual psychotherapy sessions in which ADCs were induced. In none of these cases did the patient come to psychotherapy seeking an ADC, and therefore, the ADC procedure was introduced during the course of psychotherapy. Identifying information in all cases has been altered to maintain confidentiality. Although some of these patients sought psychotherapy for help in dealing with the loss of a friend or family member, for others, the issue of loss was identified somewhat later in therapy as a contributing factor to their primary problem. For most patients, after they had successfully experienced an initial ADC, they became interested in contacting other deceased family or friends. In these cases, the loss frequently had nothing to do with the primary problem.\r\n\r\nThe cases presented here were chosen for inclusion primarily because they exemplify a particular aspect of ADC experiences that has occurred with some regularity. These particular cases were further selected for inclusion in this article because they illustrate the similarities between ADCs induced by EMDR and NDEs; it should understood that many ADCs induced by EMDR do not include these NDE-like features. My goal in all of these cases was to help people with real and sometimes very difficult problems. This was not a research project, and therefore a standard set of questions was not asked in every case, other than the ones listed in the Data Summary above.\r\n\r\n### *Bob*\r\n\r\nBob and his unit had set up camp for the night in Vietnam. He and two buddies had guard duty and they were ordered to shoot anything that moved outside of their perimeter. Later that night, they detected movement in the bush not too far from their position. All three opened fire, and it appeared that they hit whoever or whatever it was. They had to wait for daylight, however, to go out and see what it was. The next morning they all went out and found that they had shot and killed a Vietnamese woman and her infant child. The woman was unarmed and for some unknown reason had wandered close to their camp. At the time, Bob was enraged at the senseless of what had happened. For many years since the incident Bob has suffered from intrusive images of their dead bodies. When he presented this memory in psychotherapy, his primary feeling was overwhelming sadness.\r\n\r\nThe usual induction procedure was provided. However, in Bob's ADC he spontaneously went back in time to the moment the woman and child died. Although during the incident he did not see the bodies until the next morning, in his ADC he saw what looked like the spirits of the mother and child rise out their bodies at the moment of death. The mother then held the child in her arms, turned, and proceeded to drift through a large tunnel and towards a bright light. They had a very peaceful look on their faces and they appeared to move with a sense of purpose. Bob's feeling of sadness was replaced by a feeling of happiness, which he experienced during his ADC. He was also comforted by his knowledge that the mother and child had maintained their loving relationship. He believed that his experience proved that there is life after death. Bob was somewhat confused, however, by the appearance of the bright light in his ADC, because at the time of the incident it was completely dark. Bob was unaware of NDE reports, which I offered as one of the possible interpretations. A month later, after Bob successfully completed work on some other issues, he terminated psychotherapy. At that time, he no longer felt sad about this incident and all associated intrusive images had disappeared.\r\n\r\nExperiencing the NDEs of others during an ADC is not rare, and occurs most frequently when there was no relationship between the deceased and the ADC experiencer. It is also noteworthy that Bob knew nothing about NDEs prior to his ADC experience.\r\n\r\n### *Nancy*\r\n\r\nNancy's pregnancy was uneventful until the ninth month. She began vomiting and could no longer feel her baby's movement. An ultrasound revealed no fetal heart beat. Labor was therefore induced, but Nancy went into a hypertensive crisis and her baby was delivered dead. Nancy was near death herself for the next three days. At some time during those three days, Nancy experienced an NDE in which she saw her baby and her mother, who had died a few years earlier, standing together, holding hands, and looking very happy. Her baby was looking up at his grandmother. Her mother then said to her, "It's okay." Behind them was "a bright comforting light." Nancy was somewhat surprised that her baby was standing, even though he looked like a newborn. Because Nancy was so critically ill herself, her NDE provided some comfort to her only after her own physical condition had improved. These events happened six years prior to out meeting. In spite of her NDE, she continued to experience some grief over the death of her baby, especially at the time of the year that the loss occurred.\r\n\r\nNancy was enthusiastic about the ADC procedure because her NDE had convinced her that such experiences were possible. During Nancy's ADC, she again saw her son with her mother, and they both looked happy and peaceful. There were some differences, however, between her NDE and her ADC experience. This time her son looked older and much healthier than he did before, and instead of looking at his grandmother, he was looking at Nancy and reaching out with both hands towards her. Overall, Nancy had the sense in her ADC was "much clearer and more focused" than her NDE, although that may have been due to her being heavily medicated at the time of her NDE. She experienced her ADC as more comforting though, because of her sense that her mother and son were moving towards her and not away. At the end of the session, Nancy reported a much stronger connection with both her son and mother, and she believed her grief had fully resolved. A follow-up visit seven months later supported her belief. I also further questioned Nancy about her evaluation of her two experiences. She was convinced that her ADC was not merely an activation of the memory of her NDE. She was sure that they were two separate experiences that both tapped into the same spiritual reality.\r\n\r\nThis case provides an example of how people who have had both an induced ADC and an NDE subjectively experience the two as the same phenomenon. People who have had an NDE and an induced ADC where the same deceased person is not involved in both experiences are similarly convinced.\r\n\r\n### *Pam*\r\n\r\nPam's mother died nearly 30 years ago when Pam was 14 years old. She and her mother, as the only females in the family, developed a close relationship. Her mother lived only three months after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Her father and three brothers grieved her death, but Pam believed it was her job to take her mother's place as the strong one in the family, and as a result, never fully addressed her own issues regarding her mother's death. A brother also blamed Pam for their mother's rapid demise because the mother remained active in Pam's life until her death. Pam has been and continues to be a successful physician; however, she maintains an extremely demanding professional schedule that brings her, at times, to the point of exhaustion. After a year and a half of psychotherapy with another therapist, she had made some progress in terms of allowing herself to express her grief, and she had come to realize that her overly responsible caretaking role was tied in many ways to her response to her mother's death. However, these improvements had done little to help her make any significant changes in her routine, and she continued to experience significant guilt and loss over her mother's death.\r\n\r\nIn the first ADC attempt Pam found herself going through a tunnel and towards a bright light, but she found herself getting frustrated because she could not get to the end of the tunnel. She was unaware of the significance of the tunnel and light, and therefore it was reassuring for her to hear that it meant that the experience was beginning to unfold. After some EMDR to promote relaxation, another induction was performed. This time her mother was there. During her relatively long ADC, a few tears rolled down Pam's face while she kept her eyes closed. When it was over, she opened her eyes and was very excited about what had happened. She stated, "I saw my mother very clearly...She looked younger and thinner...My mother had put on weight the last ten years of her life...She looked healthy, happy, peaceful, and she had a spark in her eyes that seemed to emanate a glow around her." Pam then laughed and said, "My mother was sitting on a large rock by the beach in one of those old-style bathing suits, but the surroundings were more beautiful than any beach scene I've ever seen." Pam's mother communicated to her that she was very proud of what she had accomplished in her life, and that there was no reason for her to feel guilty about anything. Pam experienced "a warm connectedness that we used to have." Pam also pointed out than when her mother was alive "there was always a touch of sadness in here smile, but that was gone and she appeared to be genuinely happy." Pam then stated, "I can't believe how peaceful I feel, like there's been a tremendous burden lifted off of me...and I have the sense that she is not gone and will always be with me." Pam felt that all her issues related to the death of her mother had completely resolved. She emphasized more than once how unexpected her experience was. Ten months later she reported that she continued to feel much better, and that she could still experience that sam e peaceful feeling when she took the time to think about it. Although she had made plans to cut back on her rigors schedule, it was too soon to evaluate her success in that area.\r\n\r\n### *Gary*\r\n\r\nWhen Gary was a medic in Vietnam, he had an ongoing difficult relationship with his commanding officer. At one point, someone had stolen Gary's rifle, and his officer, not believing his story, ordered Gary to go out on the next mission unarmed, even though other weapons were available. Although Gary survived the mission, he felt anger and rage towards the officer for putting his life in jeopardy. His anger never subsided. Gary believed for the last 30 years that if ever saw the officer again, he would kill him.\r\n\r\nAlthough Gary had experienced an ADC in a prior session, for this issue, standard EMDR was provided in order to decrease his fear associated with that mission, which he continued to reexperience, and to decrease his anger towards the officer. After the fear was desensitized significantly, the anger was addressed. During the next set of EMDR, Gary spontaneously saw the officer standing in front of him with a concerned and caring look on his face. He told Gary that he was very sorry for what he had done, and for all the problems that Gary's ongoing anger has caused him in his life. The officer appeared to Gary to be very sincere. Gary's anger completely resolved, and he said that he forgave the officer. Since Gary had previously experienced an ADC and believed that it was actual spiritual contact, he was very surprised that person still living would appear in an ADC. After his ADC, he went to the book that lists the names of everyone who died in Vietnam. He discovered that his officer's name was in the book, and that he was killed soon after Gary left Vietnam.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that each time someone who was thought to be alive appeared in an ADC, we were later able to verify that the person had in fact died. It appears that only deceased are experienced in ADCs.\r\n\r\n### *Mark*\r\n\r\nMark was involved in a very serious car accident nearly 25 years prior to our session. Although Mark was uninjured, two adults and a 12 year-old girl, who were in the other car, were killed. He reported that he knew nothing else about the victims because he was taken away in a different ambulance, and he subsequently avoided all television and newspaper reports of the incident. The accident had been Mark's fault and he was found guilty of negligent homicide. This incident completely changed Mark's life. Although he had been a good student and had plans for a professional career, his deep sadness and severe guilt resulted in a dysfunctional life, which included recurring major depressions, two suicide attempts, failed marriages, drug abuse, and employment difficulties. Mark believed that since there was no way to undo what had happened, he was destined to suffer for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary EMDR to alleviate anxiety, an ADC was induced. Mark saw all three of the victims "standing together and smiling with a look of joy, peace, and contentment." They seemed "very happy being together and liked very much were they were." Although he had never seen these people before, he was sure it was them. He could see each one very clearly, and especially the girl, who was standing in front of the two adults. She had short red hair, freckles, and a distinctive smile. Mark also somehow got the clear impression that the male adult, who began to walk around in the scene, was communicating to him that he had multiple sclerosis before he died, and that he was happy about the fact that he was now able to move around freely. Mark privately told all three that he was very sorry about what had happened and that he felt very sad about the whole thing. Mark reported that they gave him the message that they had been waiting to hear what he had to say, and that they then forgave him.\r\n\r\nMark was astonished by his experience. He said, "I didn't picture all of this; it came to me, as clear as I'm looking at you right now...I didn't imagine it; I couldn't have imagined it." His feelings of sadness and guilt appeared to have fully resolved. He felt as though "a huge burden has been lifted off of me." He had some concern that I would think he was "crazy," but I reassured him that was not the case. Mark left the session "feeling great." The next day, however, I received a frantic phone call from Mark. He had to see me right away. He was in my office within an hour. He explained that since he was feeling so much better, he stopped by his sister's house the night before, and asked her to get out the old newspaper clippings on the accident, which he knew she had kept in her attic. He "nearly freaked out" when he saw a picture of the girl with short red hair, freckles, and the same distinctive smile. The newspaper articles also reported that the man had severe multiple sclerosis and had been wheelchair-bound for a number of years prior to his death.\r\n\r\nAlthough the day before Mark believed that his experience was real, the newspaper clippings "proved beyond any doubt that it was real." His primary concern was that the spirits of these three people might change their minds and come back to punish him in the future. I was able to reassure him that, although I had considerable experience in inducing ADCs and had read hundreds of first hand accounts, I had never heard of a single case in which an ADC was either punitive or negative. I also explained to him that it was clear the day before that all issues between the three people and him had been resolved. He left my office feeling reassured and better again. Mark continued in therapy for about two months, during which time he addressed a different issue. During that time, all issues pertaining to the accident remained resolved, and he denied any further concern about a possible negative ADC in the future.\r\n\r\nOnly infrequently is it possible to obtain independent evidence which has some bearing on the validity of ADC content. For that reason, when it does occur, it is of interest. Of course, in this case, we must rely on the reliability of Mark's reports. Although the newspaper clippings "proved" to Mark that his experience was real, they do not constitute proof for the rest of us. Even if he had shown me the newspaper articles, one could argue either that Mark was lying about having not seen them, or that the repressed the fact that he had seen them because it was psychologically too painful for him to remember. Yet, I do not believe Mark was lying, and repressing that material appears very unlikely given his age at time of the accident and his psychological history.\r\n\r\nThis case also illustrates a frequent observation that some deceased people appear to have not aged, even though they died at a relatively young age. After 25 years, the 12 year-old girl still looked like a 12 year-old. It is also noteworthy that Mark reported that the three victims of the accident were waiting to hear what Mark had to say. Although the victims were ultimately experienced as forgiving, it appears here that the resolution of unfinished business needed to occur first.\r\n\r\n# Comparison of NDEs and Induced ADCs\r\n\r\nIt has been 30 years since Elizabeth Kubler-Ross wrote *On Death and Dying* (1969), and a quarter century since Moody wrote *Life After Life* (1975). These two individuals, more than anyone else, sparked the public's interest in the experiences of those who come close to death. It is commonly accepted that roughly one-third of all people who come close to death, upon regaining consciousness, report having had a wonderful and life-changing spiritual experience. Moody labeled these experiences "near-death experiences," or NDEs. He pointed out that as a result of medical advances in resuscitation techniques, many more people were being brought back from the brink of death than in the past.\r\n\r\nThe many books on NDEs that followed Moody's *Life After Life* generally support his observations regarding the content of the experience. The general sequence of events that occur when a person is at a point close to death includes floating out of one's physical body, a feeling of indescribable peace and happiness, going through a tunnel or passageway towards a light, meeting with friends and relatives who have previously died, seeing beautiful landscapes with bright and rich colors, experiencing a life review, meeting a loving being of light, and returning to one's physical body. It should be noted that the sequence is not invariant, and frequently only one or a few of the elements are reported.\r\n\r\nThe more I became aware of the content of my patients' ADC experiences, the more I realized that they were consistently reporting almost all of same elements of NDEs, but from a very different perspective. Whereas NDEs occur as one approaches death, in ADCs one experiences another who has already died. Aside from this obvious difference, the two experiences are essentially identical.\r\n\r\nDuring ADCs the experiencer sometimes sees the whole body of the deceased and sometimes only the face. In either case, they often appear radiant or surrounded by light. Children who die very young are usually seen as older, unlike the 12-year-old girl in Mark's ADC. People who were very old or ill prior to death are always experienced as in their more familiar physical form, therefore, they can be considered to be out-of-body, or perceived as not attached to the same physical body they left behind.\r\n\r\nI have not had a single ADC case where the deceased did not look peaceful, serene, content, or happy. Almost all those who have had NDEs described a similar feeling of peace. The feeling is so pleasant that some NDE experiencers have difficulty expressing it in words. For the ADC experiencer, perceiving the deceased in such a profoundly positive emotional state greatly expedites the resolution of grief. In many instances, the person who has the ADC experiences the same feeling, as though it was somehow transmitted from the deceased. When this occurs, the feeling of peace, in most instances, immediately and completely replaces whatever feelings of loss or pain that the person brought to the experience.\r\n\r\nADC experiencers sometimes go through a tunnel or passageway before they get to the deceased. There is usually a bright light at the end of the tunnel, and experiencers somehow know during the experience that the deceased is somewhere in the light. People who have NDEs sometimes report the identical experience, and they too report meeting deceased loved ones in the light.\r\n\r\nMeeting the deceased in both ADCs and NDEs is essentially identical. They are always loving encounters. The only difference is that, in NDEs, the conversation often involves the issue of whether the NDE experiencer is to remain there or go back to his or her body, whereas in ADCs, the focus is almost always related to the grief, issues, or concerns of the experiencer, and is sometimes perceived as related to the issues and concerns of the deceased as well.\r\n\r\nBeautiful landscapes are common in the reports of both NDEs and ADCs. Beautiful trees, hills, bushes, grass, and streams are frequently reported. Colors are typically brighter and richer, and sometimes even radiant in appearance. As one ADC patient said, "It was the greenest green I've ever seen." But even more than appearance, some NDE and ADC experiencer have reported the scenery itself exudes a feeling of peace and tranquility, which is then transmitted to the experiencer.\r\n\r\nAlthough survivors do not directly experience any portion of their own life review or that of the deceased in induced ADCs, the deceased consistently appear as if they have been through a life review. In the life review portion of NDEs, the person near death experiences his or her whole life in a few brief moments. The content of the experience generally includes a special focus on feelings that were experienced at different moments in life. However, the person near death not only experiences his or her own feelings, but also those of the other people in the experiencer's life at different moments. Thus, an important part of the life review appears to be the experience of the feelings that one caused in others, some of which are positive, and some negative. Those who have experienced life reviews report that it is a profound and life changing learning experience. People who experience life reviews generally develop an increased sense of empathy and an interest in serving others. In induced ADCs, the deceased are consistently experienced as having learned from their mistakes, and as having taken responsibility for how they treated other people in life. They also appear to be very concerned about any negative feelings that they caused in others during life. This is particularly evident in those cases in which the deceased lived troubled or even violent lives. With the above considerations in mind, NDEs and induced ADCs are actually very consistent in terms of the life review.\r\n\r\nNone of my patients ever reported seeing a being of light, nor has there been any indirect evidence that the deceased had such an experience. In NDEs, this experience frequently occurs in conjunction with the life review, and the being of light usually assists people in the evaluation of their lives. The being of light, however, is consistently reported as loving and compassionate, and any negative judgments which occur during the life review are generated by experiencers themselves, when they realize the pain or hurt that they caused in others at different times during their lives.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between NDEs and ADCs is further supported by the observation that a number of my patients, usually those who did not know the deceased personally, actually witnessed the NDE of the deceased during their own ADC. This kind of experience has been associated primarily with battlefield and hospital deaths. In these ADC experiences, a perceived two-way direct communication between the patient and the deceased usually does not occur; however, important information is nevertheless received by the patient which, so far, has resolved whatever issues the patient brought to the experience. Typically, during this kind of ADC, the experiencer sees a translucent body or spirit rise from the physical body at the point of death, usually with a very peaceful or serene appearance, and sometimes then proceed through a tunnel and towards light. Grief is resolved for the patient as a result of experiencing the other person's peaceful continuation of life at the point of death. Interestingly, none of my patients who had this kind of experience had been aware beforehand of NDE content, and all were very surprised, and some even a little confused, by the experience. Bob, for example, was initially confused because he did not understand how the deceased could have moved towards a bright light, because the death had occurred at night in the jungle.\r\n\r\nA final argument that NDEs and ADCs are essentially the same phenomenon experienced from different perspectives is that those patients who have had both NDEs and induced ADCs all reported that both the quality and the psychological impact of the two experiences were essentially the same. These patients also believed, with certainty, that the two experiences tapped into the same spiritual reality.\r\n\r\nIn short, the remarkable similarities and overlap between NDEs and ADCs would lead one to conclude that they are at least closely related phenomena, whatever the mechanism might be. Perhaps, however, as experiencers have argued, they are the same spiritual phenomenon experienced from different perspectives, the NDE being from the point of view of a person approaching death, and the ADC from the point of view of an alive person contacting one who is already dead. Both suggest something about what the experience of death may be like, and remarkably, reports of both experiences are strikingly similar. If it turns out that they are both a connection to the same spiritual reality, then NDEs are not just transitory experiences that occur before one dies, because the deceased are experienced as having continued in the same general mode during ADCs.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\n    Devers, E.

ADC&#39;s are consistently reported as profoundly loving experiences that greatly assist the grieving process. Although most researchers have argued that ADCs can occur only spontaneously, Raymond Moody&#39;s research has indicated that we do have some control over the production of the experience. In this paper, I describe a new induction technique that produces ADCs in a more elaborated experience that often fosters complete resolution of grief. These induced ADCs also appear to be much more like near-death experiences (NDEs) than do spontaneous ADCs, which strongly suggests that NDEs and ADCs may be essentially the same phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>Since earning my Doctor of Psychology degree from Baylor University in 1983, I have worked in private practice and on a specialized inpatient psychiatric trauma unit. My area of specialty has been the diagnosis and treatment of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and grief. About two years ago, I began to use a relatively new and very powerful psychological treatment in a different way. My intent was simply to make an already very powerful method more efficient. However, something very strange began to happen. A good number of my patients reported to me that they had actually made spiritual contract with the deceased person they were grieving. Moreover, when patients had this kind of experience, their grief suddenly and completely resolved. I immediately became curious about whatever it was that was producing these experiences. I retraced the steps taken in each case the experience occurred, as well as in each case the experience did not occur. I was able to identify the essential psychotherapeutic components that produced the experience. By combining these components and further refining the procedure, I discovered that I could induce the experience in nearly all of my patients.</p>\n\n<p>This kind of experience is not rare for people who grieve, and they have been recorded throughout history. The phenomenon has been recently described by a few authors who have either conducted surveys, or worked directly with grieving patients. The experience is now commonly referred to as an &ldquo;after-death communication,&rdquo; or ADC. However, the current thinking in the field is that ADCs are always spontaneous, and cannot be willfully or purposefully produced. In fact, one author speculated that we will never be to induce ADCs (LaGrand, 1997). The current belief is that some people are just fortunate enough to have an ADC and experience its therapeutic benefits, while others, for some unknown reason, are not.</p>\n\n<h1>Spontaneous ADCs</h1>\n\n<p>At least four books have been recently published on ADCs. The first of these was <em>Hello From Heaven!</em> (1996), by Bill and Judy Guggenheim. They presented the results of an extensive survey of generally normal and healthy individuals who reported spontaneous spiritual encounters with deceased friends and loved ones. They labeled these experiences &ldquo;after-death communications,&rdquo; or ADCs. The authors collected first hand accounts of ADCs from 2,000 people. They estimated that as many as 20 percent of the population in the United States have experienced ADCs. Since an estimated 4 percent of the population has experienced near-death experiences (NDEs), the occurrence of ADCs is about five times greater than that of NDEs. The percentage of ADCs for parents who have lost children to death and for widows is even higher.</p>\n\n<p>The most remarkable aspect of this survey, for me, was that the 353 personal accounts of ADCs reported in the book were identical in many ways to the experiences my patients have been reporting to me, both in terms of the content of the experience and its overwhelmingly positive psychological consequences. I was immediately convinced that, in essence, we were dealing with the same phenomenon. One major difference, however, is that the Guggenheims made the argument that ADCs can only occur spontaneously, and that they cannot be purposefully produced. Other ADC researchers generally make the same claim.</p>\n\n<p>The Guggenheims described 12 types of spontaneous ADCs: sentient ADCs, one of the most common types, involve sensing or feeling the presence of the deceased; auditory ADCs, also common, involving hearing the voice of the deceased or receiving a verbal message; tactile ADCs, involving feeling a physical touch by the deceased; olfactory ADCs, involving smelling a fragrance that is associated with the deceased; visual ADCs involving seeing the deceased; ADC visions that include some form of two-way telepathic communication, distinguished from visual ADCs in that they involve &ldquo;bright, vivid colors, that radiate their own inner light&rdquo;; twilight ADCs, occurring just as people are falling asleep or waking up; sleep-state ADCs, occurring when a person is asleep, but experienced as very different from dreams; out-of-body ADCs, involving contact with the deceased while the survivor is in an out-of-body state, which may be comparable to NDEs and include going through a tunnel and towards a light before meeting the deceased; telephone ADCs, the least common form of ADC, in which people have reported actually receiving a phone call from the deceased when awake; ADCs of physical phenomena, involving unusual physical events perceived as a message from the deceased, such as a light being turned on or off, or a door being opened or closed; and symbolic ADCs, involving something in the physical environment that survivors interpret as a sign from the deceased, such as butterflies or rainbows.</p>\n\n<p>The experiential quality and content of the various sensory components of spontaneous and induced ADCs are essentially identical. People who have had either a spontaneous or an induced ADC describe the sensory components of their experience in the same way. All indications are that the two are the same phenomenon. There is, however, one major difference. Induced ADCs, as opposed to spontaneous ADCs, are almost always multi-sensory in nature, and typically involve at least the visual and auditory components, and frequently the radiant quality of the ADC vision as well. The tactile and the olfactory components are also sometimes reported in induced ADCs. The NDE-like qualities of some out-of-body ADCs are also included in many induced ADCs; however, none of my patients ever reported an out-of-body experience concurrent with his or her ADC. It appears that, in general, that the more multi-sensory and elaborated ADCs are, the more similar they are to NDEs. That is why induced ADCs are actually more similar to NDEs, than to spontaneous ADCs. This also appears to explain why spontaneous ADC researchers have apparently not considered ADCs and NDEs to be the same phenomenon.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that induced ADCs are more multi-sensory and elaborated is that the induction procedure allows much greater control of the experience, both in terms of initiating the experience and developing the different aspects of it. The main reason this difference is important is that increased control and elaboration clearly enhances the therapeutic value of the experience, which is consistent with my reading of the available case material. To offer an analogy, in many cases, the spontaneous ADC is like recognizing an old friend by chance passing in a car going the opposite direction on a highway, whereas the induced ADC is like driving to your friend&#39;s house so you can sit down and talk for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I am also not convinced that all 12 types of spontaneous ADCs listed above are true ADCs, which are clearly identifiable by their universal quality and content. It appears that some of the above categories of spontaneous ADCs are very different in this respect, and could possibly be explained by known psychological mechanisms. I am not arguing that some of these experiences are not of therapeutic value, but only that they may be a different phenomenon. &ldquo;Sensing&rdquo; the presence of the deceased, for example, may be very comforting, but it could simply be an activation of the memory of what it felt like to be with the deceased before death. Twilight ADCs may be simply hypnagogic or hypnopompic phenomena. ADCs of physical phenomena and symbolic ADCS, which also do not involve a direct sensory experience, may have more to do with the healing powers of imagination or intuition. With ADC inductions, these experiences would only be a starting point, in terms of creating a receptive mode, so that a direct and fully elaborated multi-sensory experience can occur, which will not just assist the survivor in the grieving process, but most likely provide complete resolution.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Guggenheims published the results of their survey, three other books on spontaneous ADCs have been published by different authors. Edie Devers, a practicing psychotherapist, published <em>Goodbye Again</em> in 1997, based upon her research for her M.S.N. and Ph.D. degrees. As the other books described here on spontaneous ADCs, she provided actual case material that illustrated the loving content of ADCs and the personal convictions of experiencers in the spiritual reality of ADCs. Devers believes, as I do, that the therapeutic value of ADCs is due to establishing the feeling of reconnection with the deceased.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to the psychological state necessary to experience an ADC she wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most who have had ADC believe that certain states of consciousness are more conducive to it than others&hellip;Some people believe that being in a state of quiet is the only way to experience the deceased. Others said that because they were so exhausted physically and emotionally by grief, their defenses were down; thus they were in a receptive state to experience the deceased&hellip;Others believe that one only needs to be receptive to the idea of ADC to be capable of experiencing it. (Devers, 1997, pp. 19-21)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Devers continued:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, having a receptive mind-set does not guarantee an experience for everyone. Some people who want to have experiences do not have them, and others have them, unexpectedly. In most cases the experience is initiated by the deceased&hellip;People who try to contact the deceased are generally unsuccessful. (1997, p. 22)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Devers reported that not all experiencers are immediately helped by an ADC, and that for some, ADCs leave people with a negative feeling because they either reexperience an old conflict with the deceased, or because they feel they lose the deceased all over again when the ADC ends. Devers also pointed out that &ldquo;Though [ADC] communication is usually brief and simple, it can be complicated and ongoing. When it is extended, it often not only leads to grief resolution but also helps heal the relationship between the living and deceased&rdquo; (1997, p. 29). Thus, because of the brief nature of many spontaneous ADCs, sometimes not only is resolution not possible, they can at times intensify the unresolved negative feelings associated with the loss.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that Devers correctly identified the receptive mode as the psychological state necessary to achieve an ADC. The only ingredient missing here is a method to increase or maximize the receptive mode. Of course, that is exactly what my induction technique provides. Also, because of the reliability and control in ADC inductions, all induced ADC experiences can be rather easily extended and elaborated, thereby allowing resolution of all grief and relationship issues.</p>\n\n<p>Alexandra Kennedy published <em>Your Loved On Lives On Within You</em> in 1997. Kennedy focused on the problem of unfinished business for the bereaved that frequently accompanies unresolved grief. Although her goal was to help people establish a reconnection to deceased loved ones, she did so by helping survivors develop their powers of imagination. By strengthening imaginational skills and focusing on the deceased through such techniques as internal communication, letter writing, dialogue, and imagery, the bereaved are assisted in working through a variety of unresolved issues. Whether these experiences are actual contacts with dead is less an issue for Kennedy than helping those who suffer. She purposefully did not attempt to make a distinction between purely psychological products of imagination and the more universal content of ADC experiences. Some of the experiences of her clients are suggestive of true ADCs, while others are clearly products of imagination. For example, she instructed her clients to carry on internal conversations not only with the deceased, which sometimes triggers an ADC, but also with living family members and friends. Although internal conversations in general appear to be psycho-therapeutically helpful, they tend to be highly individualized and do not offer the sudden and dramatic psychotherapeutic shifts of true ADCs. ADCs that do occur in the course of Kennedy&#39;s treatment were therefore somewhat inadvertent, which makes it significantly different from the approach to ADC induction described below.</p>\n\n<p>Another recently published book, <em>After-Death Communication: Final Farewells</em> (1997) was written by Louis LaGrand, A Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the State University of New York. His conclusions were based upon 15 years of experience with the bereaved, and generally support the findings of Guggenheim and Guggenheim. LaGrand, as many other professionals who have worked closely with grieving patients, appears to have come to believe in the spiritual authenticity of ADCs, and made a strong argument for his case.</p>\n\n<p>LaGrand began his analysis of ADCs by stating: &ldquo;It is important to emphasize that the living person is not actively seeking to make contact with the deceased&hellip;Instead it is the deceased&hellip;who seems to reach out&rdquo; (1997, p. xiii). LaGrand later in his book offered some speculation as to why all mourners do not experience ADCs. He wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I am getting at is that it may well be impossible to obtain scientific evidence to say unequivocally that the contact experience is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, true. Unfortunately, but undeniably, the evasiveness of the contact experience is another reason mainstream scientists have shunned investigation of the phenomena. Who is ever going to pull off an apparition in a laboratory setting? Who will be able to obtain the cooperation of a deceased husband to talk to his widow with researchers standing by in white coats with pencils poised?&hellip;I regret to say at this time that such a demand cannot be met, and probably never will be. (1997, p. 164).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It will be clear below that LaGrand&#39;s beliefs about the importance of who initiates the contact, and his related pessimism about the possibility of scientific study, are no longer warranted.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, then, these authors, who have had considerable experience in working with or researching individuals who have had spontaneous ADCs, come to some similar conclusions. They uniformly recognize, for example, that spontaneous ADCs significantly assist survivors in the grieving process. Yet, the process or mechanism that produces the spontaneous ADC is viewed as either a matter of speculation, or as even beyond what is knowable. It should be clearly pointed out, however, that I am not the first to induce ADCs with any consistent success. Raymond Moody began experimentation with inducing ADCs some years ago and wrote a book on the topic a few years before these more recent books on spontaneous ADCs were published.</p>\n\n<h1>Moody&#39;s Induced ADCs</h1>\n\n<p>In 1992, Moody published a report in this Journal, followed by his book <em>Reunions</em> in 1993, in which he described the experiences that subjects in his study had with departed loved ones. He induced ADCs in his subjects by utilizing the method of mirror gazing, which was developed by the ancient Greeks. In his initial study, he gathered ten emotionally healthy, professional people. Moody spent nearly an entire day with each subject individually, generally talking about the departed loved one and assisting the subject in getting into a relaxed state. At dusk the subject would sit in front of a mirrors in a setting designed to promote the experience. Of the ten subjects, five experienced ADCs. Moody reported that he has been able to increase the odds of inducing ADCs since his original study, but he did not provide any additional numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Moody therefore demonstrated that not all ADCs are purely spontaneous, and that we do have some control over their production. I strongly suspect, however, that the mirror gazing itself had less to do with the production of ADCs in his study, than did his rather involved and prolonged preparation for the experience, which assisted his subjects in achieving a relaxed and receptive state. It would not be surprising if a number of different induction procedures would work if a person were in the right frame of mind. After all, ADCs occur spontaneously under a variety of circumstances, when a person quite by chance happens to be in the appropriate receptive mode.</p>\n\n<p>The main advantages of using the induction procedure described below are that it is faster, more efficient, and more under the control of both the therapist and the experiencer. It is faster because this technique has the power to induce rapidly the psychological state necessary to achieve the experience; it literally takes only a few minutes. Also, the success rate of the method provided here is 98 percent for first attempts, which points to the greater efficiency of this method. It offers greater control of the experience because if certain issues are left unaddressed and unresolved after an initial ADC, which happens rather frequently, it is a simple matter to induce the experience again and proceed until all issues are sufficiently resolved.</p>\n\n<h1>The Discovery of the Induction Technique</h1>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most startling aspect of the discovery presented here is that these experiences are actually rather easy to produce. It does not matter if the loss is traumatic, such as the death of a child or battlefield buddy, or if the death is the more usual variety, such as the death of a grandparent. It does not matter if the death was recent, or if it occurred many decades in the past. It also does not matter what a person&#39;s religious or spiritual beliefs are prior to the experience. It works for people with deep religious convictions and atheists as well. In fact, it appears to work for anyone who is willing and able to participate in the procedure, and individual factors beyond that seem to be of no consequence. Also, interested colleagues have been able to achieve nearly identical results after being provided some instruction. In short, the technique appears to be very robust and the outcomes do not appear to be restricted by any identifiable patient or therapist variables.</p>\n\n<p>The most difficult part of losing a friend, comrade, or loved one is the deep and painful felling of loss or disconnection. The goal of current grief therapies is to help survivors achieve a level of acceptance of the loss that allows them to move on and learn to enjoy life, in spite of some continuing pain. The prevailing belief among grief therapists is that grief is never fully resolved. The approach to treating grief, which is provided here, is radically different. The goal with ADC inductions is psychological reconnection and resolution.</p>\n\n<p>In the simplest, but not necessarily least profound of these induced ADC experiences, the individual &ldquo;sees&rdquo; the deceased as happy and at peace, and still very much alive, although in a different place. Usually some form of communication also occurs. As a result of the experience, the pain of disconnection vanishes, and is replaced by a loving reconnection. The experience dramatically erases any doubts about a belief in an afterlife. Just as people who have and a near-death experience (NDE) no longer believe death is final, people who experience an ADC no longer believe their friend or loved one is really gone. Grief work from this perspective, therefore, is not a matter of saying good-bye, but hello.</p>\n\n<h2>General Considerations in the Standard Treatment of Grief</h2>\n\n<p>Grief is a very individual process that involves a variety of psychological reactions to the perception of loss. It is a natural and spontaneous response, and typically a wide variety of emotions are involved, most prominent of which are feelings of loss, guilt, and anger. Mourning involves the sharing of the feelings of grief with others, and therefore involves the social and cultural meaning of the loss. Bereavement is the objective state of having suffered a loss.</p>\n\n<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, develops from an exposure to an event that involved either actual or threatened death, physical injury, or violation of physical integrity. The three clusters of symptoms are the re-experiencing of the traumatic event, such as intrusive recollections, nightmares, and feelings of reliving the event through flashbacks; the persistent avoidance of reminders of the incident; and the persistent feelings of increased physiological arousal.</p>\n\n<p>Grief and PTSD are similar in some very important ways. The core issue of both grief and PTSD is loss, although in either case, the loss does not necessarily involve a death. In situations of overwhelming threat in which no death occurred, for example, the core issue of PTSD is often the loss of a sense of invulnerability to harm. Grief can be associated with any loss, such as loss of a job or a marriage. In this paper, induction procedure I describe is not appropriate for cases of grief and PTSD that do not involve a death. Since the core issues and dynamics of grief and PTSD are nearly identical when a death is involved, I make no further diagnostic distinctions between the two here. However, it should be made clear that PTSD is a complex disorder, and although ADC inductions provide resolution of feelings of loss, guilt, anger, and directly related intrusive symptoms, just as they do with grief, they have less of an impact on other symptoms, such as those associated with avoidance and physiological arousal. This is especially true of cases in which the PTSD is chronic and involve multiple traumas. Therefore, although ADC inductions address the most painful aspect of trauma when a death is involved, they are not appropriate for all traumas, and they do not directly address all of the PTSD symptoms, even when death is the primary issue.</p>\n\n<p>Grief is a very individual matter, and is influenced by such factors as the age of both the deceased and the survivor, the survivor&#39;s support system, the survivor&#39;s relationship to the deceased, and the cause of death. Moreover, grief usually never fully resolves. Most grief counselors would agree that it generally takes people from one to two years to reconcile a loss to the degree that they can again find enjoyment in a life without their loved one. It takes even longer than that in cases which involve the death of a child or a spouse after many years of marriage. Moreover, reminders of the loss can continue to trigger any unresolved aspects of grief for a lifetime. The primary emotional components of grief are generally recognized as the feelings of loss, guilt, and anger.</p>\n\n<p>The bond between the living is love, but when a loved one dies, the bond is pain. Helping a client work through the pain and achieve acceptance is complicated by guilt and fears of complete disconnection with the deceased. Guilt can also be associated with a wide variety of issues, but most commonly for having &ldquo;unfinished business&rdquo; with the deceased. Examples of unfinished business include never having said &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; having unresolved interpersonal difficulties with the deceased, or feeling responsible in some way for the death of the deceased. Generally, those who grieve also feel intense anger, because someone very important has been taken away. Both guilt and anger can be related to issues of blame and responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The overall goal in standard grief therapy, therefore, is to help survivors achieve a level of acceptance of their loss that allows them to learn to enjoy life again, in spite of these ongoing difficulties. The approach provided her is radically different from this perspective. The psychotherapeutic procedure that I will describe below, instead of promoting acceptance of the perceived disconnection, actually provides complete psychological resolution through establishing an experiential reconnection with the deceased.</p>\n\n<h2>Some Insights and Breakthroughs</h2>\n\n<p>People who experience normal grief, and especially those who suffer a traumatic loss, generally experience a variety of intense emotions. Feelings frequently vacillate between anger, guilt, and deep sadness or loss. A person who grieves, for example, may be crying one moment, and full of anger of even rage the next. A large portion of the job of a psychotherapist is to provide a supportive psychological environment in which these feelings can be openly expressed. Patients are told that these feelings are completely normal and they are encouraged to express them. By working through or processing these feelings, patients are usually able eventually to achieve some level of acceptance of their loss and an improved capacity to get on with their lives. Generally, however, the loss is never fully resolved, and stimuli or reminders of the loss can trigger periods of sadness, guilt, or anger for a lifetime. Over time these episodes usually decrease somewhat in both frequency and intensity.</p>\n\n<p>I have learned some important lessons over the years while treating people who suffer from loss. One insight is that feelings generally come in layers, or in a predictable order, both in terms of psychological importance and a patient&#39;s readiness to address them. Attributions of blame and responsibility, which are related to feelings of guilt and anger, can be very important from a legal point of view, but psychologically, these issues are peripheral to the core and more painful feelings of loss. Some level of acceptance can be achieved only when the feelings of loss are worked through to some degree. In psychotherapy, therefore, the expression of feelings of guilt and anger should be encouraged, so they can be processed or worked through, which in turn allows the issue of loss to be directly addressed.</p>\n\n<p>This was the general state of the art of grief work, with some of my own clinical insights included, when a major breakthrough in psychological treatment was discovered in the late 1980&#39;s by Francine Shapiro, who, while walking through a park one day and feeling upset about some troubling and recurring thoughts, found herself spontaneously shifting her eyes back and forth. She noticed that the shifting of her eyes greatly reduced the negative emotional charge and intrusive nature of her thoughts. She then tried the technique on friends and colleagues, and surprisingly, got the same results. She went on to conduct controlled scientific studies on subjects diagnosed with PTSD, and found that the technique produced psychotherapeutic outcomes unprecedented in the field of mental health.</p>\n\n<p>My colleagues and I, who had been treating patients with PTSD for many years, were initially very skeptical about what appeared to be a very simplistic procedure that produced such unbelievable psychotherapeutic results. We were open-minded enough, however, to at least give it a try. I will never forget our first application of the new procedure. One of our PTSD patients, who had been in ongoing psychotherapy with us for over three years, have us informed consent to attempt the new and experimental procedure. With myself and another psychologist observing, our colleague accomplished in 30 minutes what the patient had been unable to do in three years. It was as if somebody had just turned on a light bulb for the first time. For the next few years, psychologists across the country, myself included, began to publish scientific studies in mainstream psychological journals which supported Shapiro&#39;s findings (Lipke and Botkin, 1992). The technique is now known as eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR.</p>\n\n<p>The EMDR technique involves getting the patient to move his or her eyes in a particular rhythmic fashion while at the same time attending to a particular aspect of the traumatic memory. The therapeutic results, to those familiar with the treatment of PTSD and grief, are nothing less than astonishing. For many patients, significant desensitization of t he intrusive images and feelings associated with a particular loss can occur within a single session. Similarly, EMDR also results in a rapid cognitive restructuring of the traumatic event. We are thus in many instances able to achieve in one session of EMDR what we had been unable to accomplish after years of traditional psychotherapy.</p>\n\n<p>How EMDR works is still a matter of some debate. However, most psychologists familiar with the procedure would agree that it somehow greatly increases the brain&#39;s ability to process information. Shapiro&#39;s &ldquo;Accelerated Information Processing&rdquo; model is consistent with clinical observations. It has been known for some time that the shifting of the eyes is associated with increased brain processing. The most familiar example is that of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which occurs when we dream. It is generally agreed that the increased processing that occurs during dreaming causes the eyes to shift back and forth. With EMDR it appears that the reverse is also true, that a purposeful shifting of the eyes causes an increase in the brain&#39;s ability to process information.</p>\n\n<p>Since one can literally accomplish in a single session with EMDR what used to take years with more traditional therapies, some rather amazing events began to occur in my psychotherapy sessions. I found, for example, that EMDR allowed such a rapid processing through the layers of anger and guilt, that patients were frequently ready to access their feelings of loss in the first session. But even more than that, I found that if the patient could access the feeling of loss, to any degree and at any time, in spite of concurrent feelings of anger and guilt, and focus on it with EMDR a clinically significant level of acceptance was imminent. When the feeling of loss is rapidly processed in this manner with EMDR, one will also usually find that all of the associated anger and guilt have vanished, without even being directly addressed. This clinical observation supports the hypothesis that anger and guilt serve a protective or defensive function against the more painful feelings of loss. When the loss is directly and successfully processed, and some level of acceptance is achieved, there is simply little reason for the patient to continue to feel anger or guilt.</p>\n\n<p>With these thoughts in mind, I began to use EMDR in an even more focused way on the core issue of loss. When I did, something else very unusual began to occur. Some of my patients reported that during EMDR they made what they believed to be a spiritual connection to the deceased person they were grieving. But even more than that, they also claimed that they &ldquo;saw&rdquo; and &ldquo;talked to&rdquo; their deceased friend or loved one! Remarkably, whenever this occurred, not only did the patients immediately achieve a significant level of acceptance of the loss, they in nearly all cases also experienced a complete resolution of the loss, and all related symptoms, such as anger, guilt, and intrusive images. Many patients literally began the session in despair, and left feeling joyous. At first I believed that the EMDR had produced some sort of hallucinatory event, and that the results would not last. However, my attempts to obtain follow-up data indicated that the results did indeed last, and in fact, the results appeared to hold up over time in every case. Other clinicians have reported the production of similar spontaneous ADCs during standard EMDR treatment, with similar therapeutic results (Parnell, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>After these experiences occurred a number of times in a more or less unexpected fashion, I wanted to understand why it was that some of my patients had this experience, while others did not. I went back and examined each case in which the experience occurred, and each case in which it did not. I was then able to discern a particular sequence of psychotherapeutic eents that led to the experience. When I then applied these principles with other patients, I found that it appeared that I could induce the experience in all of them. The most remarkable aspect of this whole endeavor was that I found that it was actually very easy to do.</p>\n\n<h1>ADC Induction Procedure</h1>\n\n<p>It is important to emphasize to the reader that one must already be trained in EMDR in order to be able to use the ADC induction technique described here. For mental health professionals to obtain a &ldquo;certificate of completion,&rdquo; they must successfully complete Shapiro&#39;s level I and level II workshops. All mental health professionals recognized by state or federal licensing authorities as independent providers of mental health services are eligible for EMDR training.</p>\n\n<p>Shapiro has created some controversy in the field by maintaining strict control over the teaching of EMDR. Mental health professionals can learn the technique only by attending her two officially sanctioned workshops, which are now provided on a regular basis throughout the United States and in a few other countries. She has proceeded in this manner because EMDR is so powerful that misuse and harm to patients is a real possibility. I received both level I and level II training several years ago, and have served as a facilitator at her workshops.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, all clients or patients considered for an ADC induction should be thoroughly screened. Although I never had a patient who got worse as a result of an ADC induction, the possibility certainly exists. Theoretically, an ADC could trigger a psychotic reaction in those with a history of severe mental disorders. The most important consideration in screening patients is the potential adverse reaction to EMDR. Psychological decompensation could occur in those with a history of severe abuse. As any adequately trained EMDR therapist is aware, there exists the possibility of inadvertently uncovering repressed or partially repressed traumatic material. A good history is therefore essential. Current factors I routinely assess are overall psychological health, concurrent stressors, medications, substance abuse, suicide potential, and available social and professional support systems.</p>\n\n<p>A good psychotherapeutic relationship is essential, as are warmth, empathy, and genuineness on the part of the therapist. It simply will not work if the patient does not trust the therapist and withholds valuable information. Prior to the induction, it is important that the patient talk about his or her relationship to the deceased and the circumstances of the death. This not only assists the patient in achieving an appropriate focus, it also alerts the therapist to the potential issues that might arise during the induction. The therapist also needs to be aware of how the ADC is unfolding, so that the experience can be properly guided.</p>\n\n<p>When inducing ADCs, it is important to keep the principles described in the prior section in mind. It is also my belief, that in any application of EMDR, that the psychotherapeutic process proceeds much more efficiently if the most distressing issue is addressed first. If the memory with the greatest emotional charge is not addressed first, it can unexpectedly intrude into consciousness while one is attempting to deal with a memory that is less emotionally charged. When this occurs, no further progress can be achieved unless the more distressing memory is addressed with EMDR. If the patient is unwilling to address the more distressing memory, then all progress is halted, and the patient frequently feels worse as a result of uncovering two memories, for which further working through is no longer possible. I therefore routinely have patients rank order their issues prior to the application of EMDR. I have found that this allows psychotherapy to proceed more efficiently, more rapidly, and with fewer complications.</p>\n\n<p>Inducing ADCs works better when there is a cooperative effort between therapist and patient. Some of my colleagues, when they first attempted to induce ADCs and were unsure of the technique and their own skills, introduced the procedure to their patient in a subtle fashion. Risk of failure was therefore avoided because the patient was not quite sure what the therapist was trying to do. With this approach ADCs did occur, but the results were variable. I begin, therefore, in setting up a cooperative endeavor by explaining the procedure and inquiring about the patient&#39;s religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>For patients who do not believe in an afterlife, I ask them simply whether they believe that an afterlife is even possible. Since almost all patients will admit that there is no way to know for sure, the procedure is then offered as a cooperative experiment. The expectation that the procedure may not work appears to have no effect on the production of the experience. The patient needs only to be willing to give it a try. If the patient professes a belief in an afterlife, a different route is taken. Although these patients might initially see some potential value in the procedure, it is essential that they be instructed not to project their own beliefs into the experience. Sometimes patients need to be reminded of this more than once during the course of the ADC induction. Since ADCs appear to be universal experiences, and unrelated to a patient&#39;s particular beliefs, any attempts by the patient to create an experience consistent with his or her religious beliefs will prevent an ADC from occurring. Some patients, for example, expect to see the deceased burning in hell or floating around in the clouds in a spiritual body. In such cases, the production of an ADC is blocked and essentially nothing happens. Therefore, whether the patient has religious beliefs or not, the critical factor in ADC inductions is that the patient is open to the experience, and in a receptive mode. I sometimes tell my patients to let the deceased do the work of finding them, and that their only job is to &ldquo;open the door&rdquo; to let them in.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to the first set of EMDR, patients are instructed that they are to think about where their deceased friend or loved one is right now, while at the same time receiving the first set of EMDR. I use the phrase &ldquo;right now&rdquo; in order to discourage the patient from attempting to bring up a memory of the deceased, which is a rather common tendency. At the same time, I encourage the patient not to attempt to create the experience but just to be open to whatever happens. My co-therapist presents the technique in a more neutral manner by simply instructing the patient to &ldquo;hold the thought&rdquo; of the deceased person while receiving EMDR. The advantage of this approach is that it decreases patients&#39; attempts to project an expectation of &ldquo;where&rdquo; the deceased is &ldquo;right now&rdquo;. However, this approach also increases the likelihood of the patient bringing up a memory of the deceased. Both approaches seem to work equally well, and these minor differences therefore appear to be of no consequence. My co-therapist&#39;s technique provides a better argument that the patient&#39;s experience is not influenced by the therapist&#39;s suggestion. However, I continue to use my approach for reasons of clinical expediency. In either case, whether the patient attempts to construct the experience, or bring up a memory, it is almost always sufficient simply to remind the patient to put his or her expectations on hold, and just go with the experience.</p>\n\n<p>Patients are also instructed beforehand to close their eyes for a period of time following each set of EMDR in order to allow the experience to unfold. They are also told, however, that if a negative intrusion occurs, such as a bloody scene or an image of the deceased in a casket, they are to open their eyes and inform the therapist. Besides expectations and projected beliefs, negative intrusions can also block the ADC experience. Intrusions can take many forms besides distressing images, such as negative feelings or thoughts, or uncomfortable physical sensations. If intrusions occur, the therapist simply applies EMDR to whatever is intruding, and an ADC induction is attempted again. Intrusions do not have to be desensitized completely, but only enough to allow the ADC to develop, because once an ADC is achieved, all associated negative symptoms generally disappear. It is important to point out that if the patient&#39;s loss is traumatic and severe intrusive symptoms are part of the overall clinical picture, it is better to desensitize these intrusive symptoms to some degree before attempting the induction. If the intrusions are mild to moderate, the therapist can go ahead and attempt an ADC induction, and provide EMDR on any intrusions that arise during the course of induction.</p>\n\n<p>Frequently not all issues associated with the loss are resolved with a single ADC induction. For this reason, it is essential to evaluate the patient after each experience. If an issue is left unresolved simply instruct the patient to bring that issue (&ldquo;to have it in mind&rdquo;) and induce another ADC. It is important, however, that the patient maintain a receptive mode and not attempt to recreate the image he or she had in the preceding ADC.</p>\n\n<p>Patients are generally surprised, and even somewhat shocked, by their ADC experience. In my experience this has never been a very serious issue and most people readily change their beliefs to assimilate their experience. In fact, nearly all patients seem to like their new way of thinking more than the old. Nevertheless, some time should be taken to evaluate this aspect, and to assist patients in framing their experience in any way that is comfortable for them.</p>\n\n<h2>Additional Clinical Observations</h2>\n\n<p>Although the following are not frequently observed during ADC inductions, they occur with enough regularity to merit some attention. First, although going through a tunnel or passageway and towards light is one of the universal elements of the experience, it is at times associated with the patient not being fully relaxed, usually because the patient is trying too hard. If the patient experiences some frustration getting though the tunnel, inquire whether the patient is indeed feeling this way, provide a set of EMDR to promote relaxation, an then induce the ADC again. Frequently, the patient will then immediately experience the deceased. In general, any time the patient appears to be trying too hard and is unable to achieve an ADC, it is helpful to use a paradoxical approach by instructing the patient not to attempt an ADC during a set of eye movements, but just to focus on relaxation. An ADC frequently then develops because the patient gives up his or her attempts to create the experience, which then allows the ADC to occur naturally.</p>\n\n<p>Second, the ADC experience typically lasts only as long as it needs to from a psychological point of view. When all issues have been resolved, sometimes patients want to linger in the experience, but these patients frequently report that the experience rapidly fades. It can be supportive to point out to these patients that this is a common experience. Usually this is only a minor issue because of the overwhelmingly positive nature of the experience that has just ensued.</p>\n\n<p>Third, a few patients have expressed a concern prior to the experience that the deceased, for whatever reason, will be seen in hell. Again, simply instruct the patient to withhold all expectations about the experience. No one has yet reported a hellish scene. It is also interesting to note that even when the deceased did clearly live a life of low moral character, which has even included murder, they are nevertheless experienced as peaceful and happy, as having learned from their mistakes, and as having taken responsibility for their actions. They are also experienced as concerned about whatever pain or suffering they caused other people in life. The issue of unfinished business then, is experienced by survivors as important to the deceased as well.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, when I first began doing ADC inductions, I was somewhat surprised that a successful ADC induction with the death of one person did not seem to generalize to other deaths. Even though ADC experiencers, in almost all cases, are subsequently convinced of the reality of an afterlife, a successful resolution appears to have little or no effect on the grief associated with other losses. This observation suggests that it is the experience itself, and not any subsequent changes in beliefs, that is responsible for psychological resolution. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding that even those who do not believe in the spiritual authenticity of their experience, nevertheless report full resolution of grief.</p>\n\n<h1>Data Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Out of 84 patients for whom an ADC induction was offered, 83 (99%) were willing to participate in an induction. Of the 83 patients who participated in an induction. Of the 83 patients who participated in an ADC induction, 81 (98%) achieved an ADC, defined as any perceived sensory contact with the deceased. Of the 81 patients who achieved an ADC, 78 (96%) reported full resolution of grief following the ADC, and 76 (94%) believed their ADC was an actual spiritual contact. Of those 76 patients who believed their ADC was an actual spiritual contact, only 6 (8%) had believed prior to the ADC that actual contact was possible.</p>\n\n<p>This summary is based upon the first 84 patients to whom I offered an ADC induction. Although an overwhelming majority of patients who achieved an ADC chose to do additional ADCs with other deceased individuals, only first attempts are represented here. The total number of all ADC inductions I was involved in, including a few conducted by my co-therapist, whom I supervised, exceeds 400. In general, ADCs become even easier to induce with practice. It is clear from these numbers that patients or clients are very willing to attempt an induction for the first time, even though they generally believe beforehand that such an experience is not possible. This, of course, depends upon the trust your patient has in your ability as a therapist and his or her willingness to try something different, something that might even sound a little &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; at first. If your patient is then willing and able to participate in the procedure, an ADC will usually occur. It is also clear that people ho experience induced ADCs, in almost all cases, believe that their experience was actual contact with the deceased. The foregoing was the only information I recorded on a regular basis, other than the verbal reports of my patients. Although I initially had some interest in the potential effects of varying prior belief systems on ADC induction outcomes, I did not keep a record of those data. However, I have worked with many patients who described themselves as atheists, many who were unsure about their beliefs, and many who professed strong religious convictions. The fact that 98 percent of patients achieve ADCs no matter what they believe, as long they are able and willing to participate in the procedure, strongly suggests that the difference in subjects&#39; prior beliefs systems is of little consequence.</p>\n\n<h1>Cases</h1>\n\n<p>I provide here brief summaries of a few actual psychotherapy sessions in which ADCs were induced. In none of these cases did the patient come to psychotherapy seeking an ADC, and therefore, the ADC procedure was introduced during the course of psychotherapy. Identifying information in all cases has been altered to maintain confidentiality. Although some of these patients sought psychotherapy for help in dealing with the loss of a friend or family member, for others, the issue of loss was identified somewhat later in therapy as a contributing factor to their primary problem. For most patients, after they had successfully experienced an initial ADC, they became interested in contacting other deceased family or friends. In these cases, the loss frequently had nothing to do with the primary problem.</p>\n\n<p>The cases presented here were chosen for inclusion primarily because they exemplify a particular aspect of ADC experiences that has occurred with some regularity. These particular cases were further selected for inclusion in this article because they illustrate the similarities between ADCs induced by EMDR and NDEs; it should understood that many ADCs induced by EMDR do not include these NDE-like features. My goal in all of these cases was to help people with real and sometimes very difficult problems. This was not a research project, and therefore a standard set of questions was not asked in every case, other than the ones listed in the Data Summary above.</p>\n\n<h3><em>Bob</em></h3>\n\n<p>Bob and his unit had set up camp for the night in Vietnam. He and two buddies had guard duty and they were ordered to shoot anything that moved outside of their perimeter. Later that night, they detected movement in the bush not too far from their position. All three opened fire, and it appeared that they hit whoever or whatever it was. They had to wait for daylight, however, to go out and see what it was. The next morning they all went out and found that they had shot and killed a Vietnamese woman and her infant child. The woman was unarmed and for some unknown reason had wandered close to their camp. At the time, Bob was enraged at the senseless of what had happened. For many years since the incident Bob has suffered from intrusive images of their dead bodies. When he presented this memory in psychotherapy, his primary feeling was overwhelming sadness.</p>\n\n<p>The usual induction procedure was provided. However, in Bob&#39;s ADC he spontaneously went back in time to the moment the woman and child died. Although during the incident he did not see the bodies until the next morning, in his ADC he saw what looked like the spirits of the mother and child rise out their bodies at the moment of death. The mother then held the child in her arms, turned, and proceeded to drift through a large tunnel and towards a bright light. They had a very peaceful look on their faces and they appeared to move with a sense of purpose. Bob&#39;s feeling of sadness was replaced by a feeling of happiness, which he experienced during his ADC. He was also comforted by his knowledge that the mother and child had maintained their loving relationship. He believed that his experience proved that there is life after death. Bob was somewhat confused, however, by the appearance of the bright light in his ADC, because at the time of the incident it was completely dark. Bob was unaware of NDE reports, which I offered as one of the possible interpretations. A month later, after Bob successfully completed work on some other issues, he terminated psychotherapy. At that time, he no longer felt sad about this incident and all associated intrusive images had disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>Experiencing the NDEs of others during an ADC is not rare, and occurs most frequently when there was no relationship between the deceased and the ADC experiencer. It is also noteworthy that Bob knew nothing about NDEs prior to his ADC experience.</p>\n\n<h3><em>Nancy</em></h3>\n\n<p>Nancy&#39;s pregnancy was uneventful until the ninth month. She began vomiting and could no longer feel her baby&#39;s movement. An ultrasound revealed no fetal heart beat. Labor was therefore induced, but Nancy went into a hypertensive crisis and her baby was delivered dead. Nancy was near death herself for the next three days. At some time during those three days, Nancy experienced an NDE in which she saw her baby and her mother, who had died a few years earlier, standing together, holding hands, and looking very happy. Her baby was looking up at his grandmother. Her mother then said to her, &ldquo;It&#39;s okay.&rdquo; Behind them was &ldquo;a bright comforting light.&rdquo; Nancy was somewhat surprised that her baby was standing, even though he looked like a newborn. Because Nancy was so critically ill herself, her NDE provided some comfort to her only after her own physical condition had improved. These events happened six years prior to out meeting. In spite of her NDE, she continued to experience some grief over the death of her baby, especially at the time of the year that the loss occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Nancy was enthusiastic about the ADC procedure because her NDE had convinced her that such experiences were possible. During Nancy&#39;s ADC, she again saw her son with her mother, and they both looked happy and peaceful. There were some differences, however, between her NDE and her ADC experience. This time her son looked older and much healthier than he did before, and instead of looking at his grandmother, he was looking at Nancy and reaching out with both hands towards her. Overall, Nancy had the sense in her ADC was &ldquo;much clearer and more focused&rdquo; than her NDE, although that may have been due to her being heavily medicated at the time of her NDE. She experienced her ADC as more comforting though, because of her sense that her mother and son were moving towards her and not away. At the end of the session, Nancy reported a much stronger connection with both her son and mother, and she believed her grief had fully resolved. A follow-up visit seven months later supported her belief. I also further questioned Nancy about her evaluation of her two experiences. She was convinced that her ADC was not merely an activation of the memory of her NDE. She was sure that they were two separate experiences that both tapped into the same spiritual reality.</p>\n\n<p>This case provides an example of how people who have had both an induced ADC and an NDE subjectively experience the two as the same phenomenon. People who have had an NDE and an induced ADC where the same deceased person is not involved in both experiences are similarly convinced.</p>\n\n<h3><em>Pam</em></h3>\n\n<p>Pam&#39;s mother died nearly 30 years ago when Pam was 14 years old. She and her mother, as the only females in the family, developed a close relationship. Her mother lived only three months after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Her father and three brothers grieved her death, but Pam believed it was her job to take her mother&#39;s place as the strong one in the family, and as a result, never fully addressed her own issues regarding her mother&#39;s death. A brother also blamed Pam for their mother&#39;s rapid demise because the mother remained active in Pam&#39;s life until her death. Pam has been and continues to be a successful physician; however, she maintains an extremely demanding professional schedule that brings her, at times, to the point of exhaustion. After a year and a half of psychotherapy with another therapist, she had made some progress in terms of allowing herself to express her grief, and she had come to realize that her overly responsible caretaking role was tied in many ways to her response to her mother&#39;s death. However, these improvements had done little to help her make any significant changes in her routine, and she continued to experience significant guilt and loss over her mother&#39;s death.</p>\n\n<p>In the first ADC attempt Pam found herself going through a tunnel and towards a bright light, but she found herself getting frustrated because she could not get to the end of the tunnel. She was unaware of the significance of the tunnel and light, and therefore it was reassuring for her to hear that it meant that the experience was beginning to unfold. After some EMDR to promote relaxation, another induction was performed. This time her mother was there. During her relatively long ADC, a few tears rolled down Pam&#39;s face while she kept her eyes closed. When it was over, she opened her eyes and was very excited about what had happened. She stated, &ldquo;I saw my mother very clearly&hellip;She looked younger and thinner&hellip;My mother had put on weight the last ten years of her life&hellip;She looked healthy, happy, peaceful, and she had a spark in her eyes that seemed to emanate a glow around her.&rdquo; Pam then laughed and said, &ldquo;My mother was sitting on a large rock by the beach in one of those old-style bathing suits, but the surroundings were more beautiful than any beach scene I&#39;ve ever seen.&rdquo; Pam&#39;s mother communicated to her that she was very proud of what she had accomplished in her life, and that there was no reason for her to feel guilty about anything. Pam experienced &ldquo;a warm connectedness that we used to have.&rdquo; Pam also pointed out than when her mother was alive &ldquo;there was always a touch of sadness in here smile, but that was gone and she appeared to be genuinely happy.&rdquo; Pam then stated, &ldquo;I can&#39;t believe how peaceful I feel, like there&#39;s been a tremendous burden lifted off of me&hellip;and I have the sense that she is not gone and will always be with me.&rdquo; Pam felt that all her issues related to the death of her mother had completely resolved. She emphasized more than once how unexpected her experience was. Ten months later she reported that she continued to feel much better, and that she could still experience that sam e peaceful feeling when she took the time to think about it. Although she had made plans to cut back on her rigors schedule, it was too soon to evaluate her success in that area.</p>\n\n<h3><em>Gary</em></h3>\n\n<p>When Gary was a medic in Vietnam, he had an ongoing difficult relationship with his commanding officer. At one point, someone had stolen Gary&#39;s rifle, and his officer, not believing his story, ordered Gary to go out on the next mission unarmed, even though other weapons were available. Although Gary survived the mission, he felt anger and rage towards the officer for putting his life in jeopardy. His anger never subsided. Gary believed for the last 30 years that if ever saw the officer again, he would kill him.</p>\n\n<p>Although Gary had experienced an ADC in a prior session, for this issue, standard EMDR was provided in order to decrease his fear associated with that mission, which he continued to reexperience, and to decrease his anger towards the officer. After the fear was desensitized significantly, the anger was addressed. During the next set of EMDR, Gary spontaneously saw the officer standing in front of him with a concerned and caring look on his face. He told Gary that he was very sorry for what he had done, and for all the problems that Gary&#39;s ongoing anger has caused him in his life. The officer appeared to Gary to be very sincere. Gary&#39;s anger completely resolved, and he said that he forgave the officer. Since Gary had previously experienced an ADC and believed that it was actual spiritual contact, he was very surprised that person still living would appear in an ADC. After his ADC, he went to the book that lists the names of everyone who died in Vietnam. He discovered that his officer&#39;s name was in the book, and that he was killed soon after Gary left Vietnam.</p>\n\n<p>It is significant that each time someone who was thought to be alive appeared in an ADC, we were later able to verify that the person had in fact died. It appears that only deceased are experienced in ADCs.</p>\n\n<h3><em>Mark</em></h3>\n\n<p>Mark was involved in a very serious car accident nearly 25 years prior to our session. Although Mark was uninjured, two adults and a 12 year-old girl, who were in the other car, were killed. He reported that he knew nothing else about the victims because he was taken away in a different ambulance, and he subsequently avoided all television and newspaper reports of the incident. The accident had been Mark&#39;s fault and he was found guilty of negligent homicide. This incident completely changed Mark&#39;s life. Although he had been a good student and had plans for a professional career, his deep sadness and severe guilt resulted in a dysfunctional life, which included recurring major depressions, two suicide attempts, failed marriages, drug abuse, and employment difficulties. Mark believed that since there was no way to undo what had happened, he was destined to suffer for the rest of his life.</p>\n\n<p>After some preliminary EMDR to alleviate anxiety, an ADC was induced. Mark saw all three of the victims &ldquo;standing together and smiling with a look of joy, peace, and contentment.&rdquo; They seemed &ldquo;very happy being together and liked very much were they were.&rdquo; Although he had never seen these people before, he was sure it was them. He could see each one very clearly, and especially the girl, who was standing in front of the two adults. She had short red hair, freckles, and a distinctive smile. Mark also somehow got the clear impression that the male adult, who began to walk around in the scene, was communicating to him that he had multiple sclerosis before he died, and that he was happy about the fact that he was now able to move around freely. Mark privately told all three that he was very sorry about what had happened and that he felt very sad about the whole thing. Mark reported that they gave him the message that they had been waiting to hear what he had to say, and that they then forgave him.</p>\n\n<p>Mark was astonished by his experience. He said, &ldquo;I didn&#39;t picture all of this; it came to me, as clear as I&#39;m looking at you right now&hellip;I didn&#39;t imagine it; I couldn&#39;t have imagined it.&rdquo; His feelings of sadness and guilt appeared to have fully resolved. He felt as though &ldquo;a huge burden has been lifted off of me.&rdquo; He had some concern that I would think he was &ldquo;crazy,&rdquo; but I reassured him that was not the case. Mark left the session &ldquo;feeling great.&rdquo; The next day, however, I received a frantic phone call from Mark. He had to see me right away. He was in my office within an hour. He explained that since he was feeling so much better, he stopped by his sister&#39;s house the night before, and asked her to get out the old newspaper clippings on the accident, which he knew she had kept in her attic. He &ldquo;nearly freaked out&rdquo; when he saw a picture of the girl with short red hair, freckles, and the same distinctive smile. The newspaper articles also reported that the man had severe multiple sclerosis and had been wheelchair-bound for a number of years prior to his death.</p>\n\n<p>Although the day before Mark believed that his experience was real, the newspaper clippings &ldquo;proved beyond any doubt that it was real.&rdquo; His primary concern was that the spirits of these three people might change their minds and come back to punish him in the future. I was able to reassure him that, although I had considerable experience in inducing ADCs and had read hundreds of first hand accounts, I had never heard of a single case in which an ADC was either punitive or negative. I also explained to him that it was clear the day before that all issues between the three people and him had been resolved. He left my office feeling reassured and better again. Mark continued in therapy for about two months, during which time he addressed a different issue. During that time, all issues pertaining to the accident remained resolved, and he denied any further concern about a possible negative ADC in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Only infrequently is it possible to obtain independent evidence which has some bearing on the validity of ADC content. For that reason, when it does occur, it is of interest. Of course, in this case, we must rely on the reliability of Mark&#39;s reports. Although the newspaper clippings &ldquo;proved&rdquo; to Mark that his experience was real, they do not constitute proof for the rest of us. Even if he had shown me the newspaper articles, one could argue either that Mark was lying about having not seen them, or that the repressed the fact that he had seen them because it was psychologically too painful for him to remember. Yet, I do not believe Mark was lying, and repressing that material appears very unlikely given his age at time of the accident and his psychological history.</p>\n\n<p>This case also illustrates a frequent observation that some deceased people appear to have not aged, even though they died at a relatively young age. After 25 years, the 12 year-old girl still looked like a 12 year-old. It is also noteworthy that Mark reported that the three victims of the accident were waiting to hear what Mark had to say. Although the victims were ultimately experienced as forgiving, it appears here that the resolution of unfinished business needed to occur first.</p>\n\n<h1>Comparison of NDEs and Induced ADCs</h1>\n\n<p>It has been 30 years since Elizabeth Kubler-Ross wrote <em>On Death and Dying</em> (1969), and a quarter century since Moody wrote <em>Life After Life</em> (1975). These two individuals, more than anyone else, sparked the public&#39;s interest in the experiences of those who come close to death. It is commonly accepted that roughly one-third of all people who come close to death, upon regaining consciousness, report having had a wonderful and life-changing spiritual experience. Moody labeled these experiences &ldquo;near-death experiences,&rdquo; or NDEs. He pointed out that as a result of medical advances in resuscitation techniques, many more people were being brought back from the brink of death than in the past.</p>\n\n<p>The many books on NDEs that followed Moody&#39;s <em>Life After Life</em> generally support his observations regarding the content of the experience. The general sequence of events that occur when a person is at a point close to death includes floating out of one&#39;s physical body, a feeling of indescribable peace and happiness, going through a tunnel or passageway towards a light, meeting with friends and relatives who have previously died, seeing beautiful landscapes with bright and rich colors, experiencing a life review, meeting a loving being of light, and returning to one&#39;s physical body. It should be noted that the sequence is not invariant, and frequently only one or a few of the elements are reported.</p>\n\n<p>The more I became aware of the content of my patients&#39; ADC experiences, the more I realized that they were consistently reporting almost all of same elements of NDEs, but from a very different perspective. Whereas NDEs occur as one approaches death, in ADCs one experiences another who has already died. Aside from this obvious difference, the two experiences are essentially identical.</p>\n\n<p>During ADCs the experiencer sometimes sees the whole body of the deceased and sometimes only the face. In either case, they often appear radiant or surrounded by light. Children who die very young are usually seen as older, unlike the 12-year-old girl in Mark&#39;s ADC. People who were very old or ill prior to death are always experienced as in their more familiar physical form, therefore, they can be considered to be out-of-body, or perceived as not attached to the same physical body they left behind.</p>\n\n<p>I have not had a single ADC case where the deceased did not look peaceful, serene, content, or happy. Almost all those who have had NDEs described a similar feeling of peace. The feeling is so pleasant that some NDE experiencers have difficulty expressing it in words. For the ADC experiencer, perceiving the deceased in such a profoundly positive emotional state greatly expedites the resolution of grief. In many instances, the person who has the ADC experiences the same feeling, as though it was somehow transmitted from the deceased. When this occurs, the feeling of peace, in most instances, immediately and completely replaces whatever feelings of loss or pain that the person brought to the experience.</p>\n\n<p>ADC experiencers sometimes go through a tunnel or passageway before they get to the deceased. There is usually a bright light at the end of the tunnel, and experiencers somehow know during the experience that the deceased is somewhere in the light. People who have NDEs sometimes report the identical experience, and they too report meeting deceased loved ones in the light.</p>\n\n<p>Meeting the deceased in both ADCs and NDEs is essentially identical. They are always loving encounters. The only difference is that, in NDEs, the conversation often involves the issue of whether the NDE experiencer is to remain there or go back to his or her body, whereas in ADCs, the focus is almost always related to the grief, issues, or concerns of the experiencer, and is sometimes perceived as related to the issues and concerns of the deceased as well.</p>\n\n<p>Beautiful landscapes are common in the reports of both NDEs and ADCs. Beautiful trees, hills, bushes, grass, and streams are frequently reported. Colors are typically brighter and richer, and sometimes even radiant in appearance. As one ADC patient said, &ldquo;It was the greenest green I&#39;ve ever seen.&rdquo; But even more than appearance, some NDE and ADC experiencer have reported the scenery itself exudes a feeling of peace and tranquility, which is then transmitted to the experiencer.</p>\n\n<p>Although survivors do not directly experience any portion of their own life review or that of the deceased in induced ADCs, the deceased consistently appear as if they have been through a life review. In the life review portion of NDEs, the person near death experiences his or her whole life in a few brief moments. The content of the experience generally includes a special focus on feelings that were experienced at different moments in life. However, the person near death not only experiences his or her own feelings, but also those of the other people in the experiencer&#39;s life at different moments. Thus, an important part of the life review appears to be the experience of the feelings that one caused in others, some of which are positive, and some negative. Those who have experienced life reviews report that it is a profound and life changing learning experience. People who experience life reviews generally develop an increased sense of empathy and an interest in serving others. In induced ADCs, the deceased are consistently experienced as having learned from their mistakes, and as having taken responsibility for how they treated other people in life. They also appear to be very concerned about any negative feelings that they caused in others during life. This is particularly evident in those cases in which the deceased lived troubled or even violent lives. With the above considerations in mind, NDEs and induced ADCs are actually very consistent in terms of the life review.</p>\n\n<p>None of my patients ever reported seeing a being of light, nor has there been any indirect evidence that the deceased had such an experience. In NDEs, this experience frequently occurs in conjunction with the life review, and the being of light usually assists people in the evaluation of their lives. The being of light, however, is consistently reported as loving and compassionate, and any negative judgments which occur during the life review are generated by experiencers themselves, when they realize the pain or hurt that they caused in others at different times during their lives.</p>\n\n<p>The relationship between NDEs and ADCs is further supported by the observation that a number of my patients, usually those who did not know the deceased personally, actually witnessed the NDE of the deceased during their own ADC. This kind of experience has been associated primarily with battlefield and hospital deaths. In these ADC experiences, a perceived two-way direct communication between the patient and the deceased usually does not occur; however, important information is nevertheless received by the patient which, so far, has resolved whatever issues the patient brought to the experience. Typically, during this kind of ADC, the experiencer sees a translucent body or spirit rise from the physical body at the point of death, usually with a very peaceful or serene appearance, and sometimes then proceed through a tunnel and towards light. Grief is resolved for the patient as a result of experiencing the other person&#39;s peaceful continuation of life at the point of death. Interestingly, none of my patients who had this kind of experience had been aware beforehand of NDE content, and all were very surprised, and some even a little confused, by the experience. Bob, for example, was initially confused because he did not understand how the deceased could have moved towards a bright light, because the death had occurred at night in the jungle.</p>\n\n<p>A final argument that NDEs and ADCs are essentially the same phenomenon experienced from different perspectives is that those patients who have had both NDEs and induced ADCs all reported that both the quality and the psychological impact of the two experiences were essentially the same. These patients also believed, with certainty, that the two experiences tapped into the same spiritual reality.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the remarkable similarities and overlap between NDEs and ADCs would lead one to conclude that they are at least closely related phenomena, whatever the mechanism might be. Perhaps, however, as experiencers have argued, they are the same spiritual phenomenon experienced from different perspectives, the NDE being from the point of view of a person approaching death, and the ADC from the point of view of an alive person contacting one who is already dead. Both suggest something about what the experience of death may be like, and remarkably, reports of both experiences are strikingly similar. If it turns out that they are both a connection to the same spiritual reality, then NDEs are not just transitory experiences that occur before one dies, because the deceased are experienced as having continued in the same general mode during ADCs.</p>\n\n<h1>References</h1>\n\n<pre><code>Devers, E.

1	Spontaneous Healing	Judith K. Williams	It was the autumn of 1964. I was 18 years old and had not been feeling\nwell for quite some time and I didn't know why. My mom was cleaning the\npantry as she did every year. I laid down on the couch and felt guilty\nbecause I wasn't helping. At that point that I decided I might feel\nbetter if I got up and started moving around.\n\nWe washed the shelves, cleaned all the dishes and I was in the process\nof putting a large stack of dishes back on the shelf when I blacked out\nand blood started pouring out of my mouth. The next thing I knew, I was\nsitting in the bathroom. My mother and brother had changed my clothes\nand I was wondering what was going on. I guess my mom was upset because\nI made a mess out of the pantry again. They called for an ambulance but\nit wasn't there yet, so my mother and brother took me to the emergency\nroom at Christ Community Hospital on the south side of Chicago.\n\nOnce in the emergency room, the blood started pouring out of me again. I\ncovered a nurse in blood. I remember feeling very, very cold. When they\nput the blood pressure cuff on my arm, it felt like they were crushing\nmy arm. It hurt. At that point, they started pumping whole blood into\nme. I blacked out.\n\nI felt myself get up and leave my body from the center of my forehead to\nthe center of my chest. I was whisked away through a dark tunnel. I saw\nwhat appeared to be an opening filled with light and an gorgeous orchard\nof trees covered with pink flowers. It was so beautiful. I wanted to go\nthere. I was amazed because in my earthly life I didn't even like pink!\n\nWhen I started to go into the orchard, I was pulled to the left and was\ninstantly engulfed in the most beautiful white light. I never felt such\ncomplete love, complete understanding, complete compassion in my life. I\nfelt like I was just sitting in this light and being loved. I don't\nknow how long it lasted. I really wanted to stay.\n\nAt one point while I was next to the light, I had a life review that\ntook a split second. Everything was happening at once and it was over in\na flash. I was told that my life was ok. It was then that I realized\nthat I was without a body and I felt frantic for a moment. I was allowed\nto look beyond and see what seemed to be the entire Universe. It was\nbeautiful and there was a realization that I knew everything that had\never happened or would ever happen ---I had total and complete knowledge\nof everything.\n\nAgain I was engulfed in the white light and again I made it known,\nthrough thought transference or telepathy, that I wanted to stay. But I\nwas told that I was not finished yet and I had to go back. At that\nmoment I found myself back in the emergency room on the table with a\npriest standing over me, giving me last rites.\n\nI found out later that my mother and brother had been told that I was\ndead. They had pumped 21 pints of whole blood into me. When I came back\nthe bleeding stopped and they couldn't find any reason for it to have\nhappened. They had suspected a bleeding ulcer, but they could find no\nevidence of it. I never had a reoccurrence. They said I should have felt\na lot of pain, but I never felt any pain at all.\n\nI never considered myself an outgoing individual prior to this\nexperience. But for years afterward I reached out and joined every\nreligious organization that I could find, trying to find an answer to\nwhy I needed to come back, what it was that I was supposed to do, and\nalso to try to find a place where I could recapture some of what I felt\non the other side.\n\nI never mentioned this experience to anyone for many years, because I\nwas afraid people would think I was crazy. I'm still not sure why it\nhappened to me or what I am supposed to do. Possibly it's just to let\nothers know that there is something to the "Other Side" and death is\nnot to be feared.\n\n	2011-08-06 03:42:29.215292	2005-08-14 10:25:15	<p>It was the autumn of 1964.

2	My Near Death Experiences	Trudy Morse	Trudy Morse  \n <cite>Hermes at the Crossroads</cite>  \n Hermes Press - 1996 Written September 9, 2000.  \n For more information about Trudy, visit her website at:\n[http://www.the-temple.net/trudy/][1]\n\n    \n    A NDE, as it is called today,\n    is a rather frightening ex-\n    perience, but since I have\n    been privileged to have\n    had three in my lifetime,\n    actually I feel blessed.\n    \n    The first NDE was almost\n    50 years ago, while giving\n    birth to my son, Michael,\n    I found myself being twirled\n    through a dark tunnel, with\n    a bright light at the end.  I\n    woke up hysterical, I thought\n    the baby had died.\n    I was rather surprised when\n    the phenomenon was analyzed\n    many years later, it was I who\n    was near death, and not the\n    baby.\n    \n    As a result of this startling\n    experience, "Training for Child-\n    birth" was pioneered in the\n    Washington, D.C. area with Sue\n    Patch, sister of Gloria Steinman,\n    President.  Trudy Morse, Treasurer.\n    My son, Dr. Melvin Morse,\n    pediatrician, who writes about\n    NDE's in children, was the\n    first baby born, under this new\n    program, over 40 years ago.\n    \n    Our program was to train parents\n    in natural childbirth.  Dr. Dick Reid,\n    of the UK, was the leader of the\n    movement in those days.  We were the\n    first to bring fathers into the delivery\n    room, exercises for mothers, and\n    coaching lessons for fathers, to give\n    support for the mothers.\n    \n    The second time I had a NDE,\n    I saw the pattern of\n    my whole life before me, and\n    repented, that before the NDE,\n    I hadn't been a really good cook.\n    Saying farewell, I asked Malcolm\n    to forgive me, before passing out\n    during an asthma attack.\n    \n    And from that experience I learned\n    that it's very good to be ready to\n    meet your maker and a quick review\n    of your life is a strong probability!\n    \n    I am still not a very good cook, but\n    don't feel guilty, since Malcolm\n    assured me that was not why he\n    married me.  The medics had revived\n    me at home, and I felt at peace that\n    Malcolm had forgiven me during my last\n    moments.\n    \n    From that experience, I learned\n    that life is so fragile, I would try\n    to enjoy every moment of life with\n    an extraordinary husband, Malcolm\n    Morse, who was my partner for\n    some 40 years.\n    \n    At the age of 55, when he was diag-\n    nosed as having cancer, I insisted\n    that he retire so that we may have\n    the last years of his life, roaming\n    the planet, so that he might have\n    a last look at every location he was\n    curious about, had read about in science,\n    literature, the Bible, politics and\n    even science fiction.  He remained\n    alive another 13 years.\n    \n    A practicing Yoga, he died a Yoga's\n    death, in peace, in lotus position, and\n    I stayed over 3 hours, singing and\n    chanting, for an easy departure of the\n    soul.  I was at peace that I had helped\n    fulfill his mission of life.  He examined\n    anomalous phenomena for some six\n    months each year, all over the globe.\n    \n    This last NDE at the senior age of 81\n    was an extraordinary revelation.  An\n    asthma victim almost all of my life,\n    I was unable to pull out of an asthma\n    attack at the home of one of my dearest\n    members of my extended family, GILA.\n    \n    I had overdosed on medication, which\n    brought me deeper in the helpless\n    stage.  911 was called, the ambulance\n    appeared immediately, the medics\n    correctly diagnosed the incident as\n    pulmonary arrest, and were able to\n    revive me within the six minutes\n    before brain damage.  It was a quick,\n    efficient action that made for the\n    success of the treatment, every one\n    cool and collected to do what needed\n    to be done.\n    \n    Now, what did I learn in the experience\n    during my twilight years?\n    \n    The most touching was the miracle\n    of the assembly of the family.  They\n    arrived at the hospital shortly after\n    the ambulance, and were there with\n    complete support for me.\n    \n    As important as modern life-supporting\n    machinery and professional help is, I\n    needed my dearest and most beloved\n    family.  Sarah never left my side and I\n    deeply felt her presence, as well as\n    Mary's, who never left Sarah.\n    \n    Later, Dr. Serena Fox appeared.  She\n    works at the Trauma Center at Columbia\n    Hospital for Women, spent time with\n    the doctor on call, Dr. Remy.  He had\n    heard of her, by reputation, and with\n    continual telephone calls to my own\n    family doctor, Dr. Douglas Shumaker,\n    they were an extraordinary medical team\n    put together in this extreme emergency.\n    \n    Needless to say the nurses are God's\n    gift of angels to care for us.  They told\n    me later, the incident took them by\n    complete shock.  The possibility of\n    brain damage loomed very large in\n    their minds.\n    \n    Now what happened to the NDEer:\n    First, there was a black cage I was trying\n    to frantically trying to escape, banging\n    each corner post.  In despair, I finally\n    gave up:  "Well, if this is Hell, Heaven is\n    probably boring."  (This is what my son,\n    Alan, says I reported late Thursday night\n    of the discharge."\n    \n    Although that vision appears to have come\n    first, what I remember vividly, is a white\n    casket with heavily clad manacled boots\n    thumping each corner tightly closed.\n    \n    Perched on the ceiling, was the Raphael\n    angel, with lovely face cupped into hands,\n    watching the event, with much wonder,\n    watching the casket-thumping, admiring\n    its beautiful painting of stars, crescents,\n    and other beautiful colorful patterns,\n    covering the casket, gleaming, glowing\n    white, like a Rauschenberg painting.\n    \n    The thumping of each corner finished,\n    the casket securely closed, the Raphael\n    angel perched on the ceiling watching\n    carefully, wondered:\n    \n    "Well, which would have been better,\n    Heaven or Hell?"  And with a wry smile:\n    "Who knows?"\n    \n    I had finally been restrained from\n    fighting the staff who were trying to\n    insert the indo-trachial tube directly into\n    the mouth, to hook up the lungs with\n    the support machine, necessary to get the\n    lungs working again.  Michael, who had\n    been helping the staff in their struggle, was\n    severely scratched, which was an agonizing.\n    moment for him. Everybody involved later\n    told me they went into complete shock after\n    this experience .\n    \n    I was so determined to keep off the\n    machines!I had always said I would\n    rather die than be hooked up on a\n    machine, and I really meant it!\n    \n    Now that it is all over, I feel truly\n    blessed again. With such a remarkable\n    family who by some miracle arrived,\n    without anybody knowing where to call\n    them! With such extraordinary extended\n    family giving further support.  And the\n    remark of the social worker really\n    moved me. When I asked her why\n    she was visiting me, she told me most\n    of the elderly patients have no one at\n    home to go to, and she provides volun-\n    teers and visiting nurses, meals on wheels.\n    \n    What a wonderful feeling, to have Sarah\n    there every moment, demanding that I be\n    taken home at once, rather than the two\n    week period they suggested and David,\n    her husband, taking over all the chores of\n    the four children left at home during Sarah's\n    24 hour vigilance.\n    \n    Sarah decided three days in the hospital\n    was enough. She demanded my release\n    at once, and armed with the X-rays, she\n    drove me to her home. Maurie was there\n    with a broad smile. Michael had already\n    left work, and was waiting to pick\n    me up.\n    \n    Erica had decorated the front doorway:\n    "Welcome home". Lauren, who had\n    grown at least 12 inches during the\n    summer, had to lean over to embrace me.\n    \n    And Mary was there with a dinner, eaten\n    outdoors, overlooking her glorious garden\n    and little pool with the waterfall creating\n    the sound of running water which I love.\n    \n    Michael took me shopping for my bagels,\n    picked up my medicine. And Guy and Sheri\n    took over from there.  They explained the\n    medication, assuring me it was very mild\n    and only a short course. Dr. Shumaker\n    assured them it would not interfere with\n    the effective plendil I take for high blood\n    pressure.\n    \n    Dr. Shumaker insisted I call him at home\n    to strongly advise against my trip to Syria\n    scheduled for the next day. I felt so much\n    had done for me, I better not let them\n    down and create new problems, so I can-\n    celled the trip. My beautiful extended\n    family member Paula, of Signature Travel,\n    got to work at once to assure that I get\n    money back for airfare.\n    \n    I came away with the realization that\n    although I say I am ready to die, there's a\n    whole crew of people, medical and family,\n    who seemed to think it important that I\n    live a little longer.  Like the birth of a baby,\n    the rebirth of an adult requires instant\n    loving, nurturing for the health of the\n    new model.\n    \n    My son, Dr. Melvin Morse, pediatrician,\n    who has pioneered in NDE with children,\n    presents, during his lectures, pictures that\n    children draw about their experience.\n    Some are pictures of Jesus, pets, teachers,\n    or parents, whom they have just seen.\n    They are usually told to return, depending\n    upon their belief system.\n    \n    For me there was no such picture. No\n    persons, no Jesus, no favorite aunt, mother,\n    or spouse, only at first, a crude black cage\n    from which I was frantically pounding,\n    trying to escape.  In some disgust, I just\n    gave up, thinking: "Oh  well, Heaven would\n    probably be boring anyway!"\n    \n    Then appeared a white casket, with\n    heavy manacled boots pounding each\n    corner tightly shut.  Beautiful and gleaming\n    white. Stars, crescents and colored figures\n    were painted on the lid, in Rauschenberg\n    style.  Above it all a Raphael angel watched\n    from the ceiling, finally wondering if\n    Heaven or Hell would be better!\n    \n    Who knows?\n    \n    WHAT DO I MAKE OF ALL OF THIS?\n    \n    Our holiest prayer in Judaism is the Shma Yisroel,\n    Adonoi Elehanu, Adonoi Echod. Hear oh Israel,\n    The Lord our God, The Lord is one.\n    \n    The Adonoi is a Hebrew Tetragrammaton,\n    having four Hebrew Letters, usually transliterated\n    YHWH or JHVH, that forms a biblical proper\n    name of God.  Reb Shneyer has told us that\n    Adonoi means past, present, and future.\n    \n    I feel a deep sadness that my departed partner,\n    Malcolm was not witness to this. An internationally\n    recognized engineer, he was also a Polymath.\n    Equally as versed in Philosophy, Poetry, Plato,\n    Plotinus, Literature, Eastern and Western Religions.\n    \n    In raising our six children, he constantly reminded\n    me that when the child is born, images of his past,\n    present, and future are embodied on the brain.\n    \n    Since I saw no persons, heard no voices, I personally\n    conclude that it was the high tech machinery, and\n    the total high level family and medical support\n    that brought about the return. Maybe, this return\n    was guided by either the images of the brain\n    already imprinted at birth:  maybe, God whom Jung\n    defines as SELF, maybe, just plain GILA.\n    \n    Death is not Real\n    But Birth to a\n    New Life\n    We go on and on\n    To higher planes\n    For eons and aeons\n    Of Time\n    \n    The Universe is\n    Our Home\n    We explore the\n    Farthest Recesses\n    We dwell in the\n    Finite Mind\n    Of The All\n    \n    I die gladly\n    So I may Know\n    The Whole Truth\n    Of Being\n    At One with\n    The ALL\n{: .pretty}\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.the-temple.net/trudy/ \n	2011-08-06 03:42:29.240581	2005-08-14 10:25:15	<p>Trudy Morse<br>\n <cite>Hermes at the Crossroads</cite><br>\n Hermes Press - 1996 Written September 9, 2000.<br>\n For more information about Trudy, visit her website at:\n<a href="http://www.the-temple.net/trudy/"><a href="http://www.the-temple.net/trudy/">http:&#47;&#47;www.the-temple.net&#47;trudy&#47;</a></a></p>\n\n<pre><code>A NDE, as it is called today,\nis a rather frightening ex-\nperience, but since I have\nbeen privileged to have\nhad three in my lifetime,\nactually I feel blessed.\n\nThe first NDE was almost\n50 years ago, while giving\nbirth to my son, Michael,\nI found myself being twirled\nthrough a dark tunnel, with\na bright light at the end.

3	A Native American  NDE and Past Life:  An Interview with RC	Diane Willis	DW: You said you had a time when you almost died. Would you describe\nthat experience?\n\nRC: I was involved in a traffic accident with two other people. We were\non our way to work in San Diego, California, over on Coronado Island, in\n1970. I was lying down in the back seat, trying to get some more rest\nbefore we got to our job site. We came around this corner and a Cadillac\npulled out in front of us and there wasn't enough time to hit the\nbrakes or anything. We were going 35 miles per hour and WHAM, we hit the\nback of this car and I flew forward, face on, into the back of the\npassenger seat in front of me and then I fell back down. It apparently\nwas enough of a trauma to begin to impact me but I wasn't aware of it.\n\nI got out of the car and a state highway patrolman was standing there.\nHe said, "No, no, you've got to lie down. You're really injured." I\ncouldn't feel anything wrong. He continued, "Just sit down here on the\ncurb. You've got to wait until the ambulance comes." And we were\nwaiting and then I stood up again and he said, "No, you can 't stand\nbecause you're very injured." I said, "I feel fine." He said, "No,\nI'd rather have you sit down." So on my way to sitting back down\nagain, I guess I collapsed. The last thing I remember was the officer\nsaying, "Don't get blood on my uniform. I just had it dry cleaned."\n\nThen I blacked out. It started like a bunch of little squares growing in\nfront of my eyes and I was out for a while, but it felt to me like\nseconds. Then there was this feeling like a tingling, and a real long\nnoise, an audible buzzing noise, which was kind of like the sound a\nlocust makes---when all of a sudden the world opened up and there was\nthis huge immense light everywhere and it wasn't like clouds or\nanything familiar. It was just this huge bright awareness. And I could\nfeel that I was everything and to me it felt like I was there for\nminutes---just being awe-inspired by looking out and something in my\nmind was telling me, "You are all this. You are all this."\n\nI was seeing light but it was like being in clouds when I'm flying in\nairplanes---so I like to do that now. A bright day, flying through the\nclouds at 30,000 feet and it's like that. But you're not in the plane.\nYou're in the clouds. And you're not falling. So it feels like you're\nbeing held in outer space. You know, it just holds you and you become a\npart of it. It's like being a giant marshmallow. It's warm. It's\nenclosing. There's no hunger. There's no sorrow. No emotions except\npure awareness. Everything opens---as they say, the third eye.\nEverything. All your senses are ---you are totally in it and it just\nhappens, and it is like,"Wow," and I knew in my mind that everything\nthat I was witnessing or experiencing in my life was me and it felt\nwarm. I felt very comfortable and I was standing. I now know I was\nstanding because I could see myself standing and feel myself being in\nthat space and being drawn in and--- "It's not your time, why are you\nhere? Now it's time to go back." And I thought, "There must be\nmore." "No, it's time to go back." It was like me, speaking to\nmyself.\n\nI don't know. That's the only thing I can say to put it very simply so\npeople can understand it.\n\nI didn't want to come back, but when I woke up, I was lying in an\nambulance and the policeman was by me and he said, "I told you. Now\nyou're awake, but I told you 'Don't pass out.' Now I have to go home\nand get my uniform dry cleaned again." I said "I'm sorry. I just\npassed out for a moment." He said "No. It was about a half an hour.\nYou almost died on us." I said "No. All I did was hit the back of the\nseat in this car." And I noticed I was all bandaged up and I said\n"What's all this stuff?" And he said, "Well, there's a huge gash.\nYour teeth are here in this cup and you were knocked out, and we think\nyou have some back damage and you might have some broken ribs." And I\nsaid, "No--not possible. I just passed out for a moment. I'll find\nsomeone to dry clean your uniform for you. At least I can do that." He\nsaid, "No. They're going to take you to the hospital now." ---and\nthey did.\n\nHe said it was 30 minutes. I thought it was the snap of a finger---just\na flash --just an instant--I saw this huge thing. All I know is that I\nknow what's over there now and I'm very secure in the fact that I\ndon't have to be afraid.\n\nDW: You're not afraid to die now?\n\nRC: No.\n\nDW: Were you afraid before?\n\nRC: Probably. I think most people are. But I know now what I am.\n\nAfter it was over, I thought my world had ended. I had split my lip\nopen. There was significant nerve damage through my upper lip and cheek,\nso I could no longer play the brass instruments. After it all healed up\nand all the stitches were taken out on the inside, I realized that the\ndoctor had put the teeth back the way he thought they should belong and\nthey were all out of order. So now my embouchure was destroyed. The\nmusculature was destroyed. I'm still trying to play the trumpet,\nbecause that was my dream, that's my sound.\n\nBut I got home and I spent a whole year moping around, trying to get\nmyself back. And we went to Santa Fe, NM, and I found a man who was\nwalking around at the Indian Market with a basket full of flutes and he\nwas a flutemaker from San Diego by the name of Oliver W. Jones, who is a\ndoctor on genetics. His hobby was making flutes. So we talked to him a\nlittle bit and we traded some beadwork that we had for the flutes and\nkind of looked at them and hung them on the wall. They were nice\nlooking.\n\nAnd then one day my friend says, "Here, take these things. Spiders and\nbugs are living in them. They're nice. Why don't you try to play them\nand see what you can do with them?" So that started the whole thing.\n\nI'm here on a mission. I'm here on a job to do something, so when I'm\nthrough I'll go back and I don't have that fear because as I talk with\nelders about it they say, "It sounds like you've gone there and done\nthis---but here's the secret: You can't choose to go. You've got to\nlet it come in its own time because you're here for a reason. There's\na purpose in why you're here and you have to understand that before\nyou're allowed to go back.\n\nWhen I had that accident I was told that it's not my time. And what was\nintuited to me was my time will come but first I have to do this. And\nall these things are in my mind. And I can't explain it and there's no\nreal way to explain what it felt like to be there, but it was WONDERFUL.\nSo I can't wait to die---because I know what the gift is.\n\nWhat I intuit from that is that I am one of the nerve endings in this\nhuge entity of everything that exists, the cosmos, everything. I am one\nof those little nerve endings and I am experiencing for this huge\nawareness what it means to be me or you or you or you or this or that.\nAnd when we all leave from here we all go back to ourselves and we say,\n"That was fun. This is what I experienced." And maybe it will say\n"God, I'm wonderful. Go do it again." So like a giant kid you say,\n"Ok. What am I going to do this time?" And that's the only thing I\ncan think of to explain what it means.\n\nIt's like reincarnation---it's a different experience the next time.\nSo you've got to make the most of being here now. You've got to live\nin your dream and smile with a shit-eating smile on your face and walk\naround like you know everything. We are still children. Learn to love\nyourself. That's where it's all at. And in that way, you'll love your\nlife. We are all varied and different because our life experiences are\nnot all the same and they're not meant to be. You're here to become of\nservice to others and that's what it's all about---to become of\nservice to others.\n\n### Spirit Guides\n\nBut there are certain things that happen now in my life which make me\nknow I'm being guided, because there are two people who come to me in\nmy dreams and they've given me symbols that I use now.\n\nDW: Do you know who they are?\n\nRC: No. They look like two native men to me. They wear business suits\nand carry briefcases, but they have braids. They are younger. They say:\n"Now you're a part of us---but you have to spread this symbol all over\nthe world because you belong to us now."\n\nDW: What is the symbol?\n\nRC: It is a circle with four quadrants, but the one they gave me has\nmountains on it. And I drew that one too. It has mountains and an eagle\nfeather in the middle--which really isn't an eagle feather. It's sort\nof a dream of change. But it's a symbol of something... some power or\nsomething.\n\nIt's done on white paper, with embossing. And these mountains are\nsupposed to be the space that we all live in and this is the physical\nplane. This is the message, the dream. These are the directions that we\nare suppose to be aware of. This is the journey that we're on. But the\ndream is always primary. These blank spaces are also important because\nit's three-dimensional. There's a line or trail that comes out and\ngoes away. That's the path that we're born into and then we leave on.\nSo those parts you don't see. These are roads of life experience. It's\nlike a figure eight but it moves so the figure eight is moving too. So\nyour symbol is always in action one way or another. The areas in here\nare for storing information.... physical, spiritual. That's called\nATOKA.\n\nDW: What does that mean?\n\nRC: I don't speak Lakota, but a lady said, "This is a word we don't\nuse any more. Where did you get that word?" I said, "It just came,"\nand I showed her this symbol and she said, "That's what you're\nsupposed to do." She said it means something sacred, unexplainable. "I\ndon't even know what the word means but we used it like 'Wapunkanta'\nwhich means great mystery," and that was the other part of it. She said\n"What I do know is that we know that we came from somewhere else and\nwe're on this journey. It's spiritual , it's physical, it's\nphilosophical. It's everything at once. But we've lost the mentality\nto understand that part. I don't know where you got this word. Nobody\nknows this word except Lokota Holy men."\n\nSo I told her about these two young guys that come to me that have long\nhair and business suits and everything. And she said: "Do they look\nlike this?" And I said , "Yes." And she described these different\npeople to me and she said "They are like twins, but they are also hero\nbrothers and they're guardians. They are giving you something. It's\nvery, very spiritual and sacred and you'll know the rest, but keep all\nof this stuff because somewhere you're supposed to do something with\nit." And that's all I know.\n\nSo I still have the original drawing and the story that came to me in\nthat dream. And then the subsequent dream when they gave me this one and\nthe story that goes with this. And the only thing they told me, as they\nwere peeling the paper off the back and sticking it on trash cans and\nwindows, was: "You're gonna spread this thing all over the world."\n\nI'm supposed to make it physical and then give it to people. So I'm\nstill in the process of getting that done and it's been about 12 years\nnow, but the Natives are still here---even when I'm working. And the\nsymbol is always with me. I use it all the time. It's on everything I\ndo. So they're helping me to get this message across.\n\nDW: If there's a way to save the world and to bridge the gap between\npeople, it's through....\n\nRC: self-awareness and the awareness that we're all connected\nphysiologically. It's a very simple concept. Why people don't get it\nis beyond me because if I know this, you should know this too. Why do\npeople fear?\n\nI know the two people that follow me say, "Everything that will come to\nyou is a gift and make sure that you take it. But when you refuse a gift\nthe first time, it won't come back to you and then you're on your\nown." But now I realize what the gift is. It's anything. It could be\nmoney. It could be stuff. But it comes to me, because it's not for me.\nIt comes to me and then later someone always comes and says "I really\nneed this" and I say "I have this and I don't need it and I want you\nto have it." So I've sort of become a go between.\n\nAnd even what I do musically is that way, too. It doesn't belong to me.\nIt moves through me because that's what I'm supposed to be doing . And\nwhen I do that and give it freely to others then it's now theirs. It's\nthe gift. And I have no control over it. I mean. It takes me, too. I'll\nbe doing these performances and lectures and suddenly I'll be somewhere\nelse and my mind will be shut, but I'm talking about something I've\nnever done before, and I think, "Where does this come from? I've never\ntaught this stuff before and why am I saying it now?"\n\nOr I'll be talking and then it will change and I'll zero in on\nsomeone, and I won't physically look at them but I will suddenly begin\nspeaking about something and then they say, "That's exactly why I came\nhere." And I go, "Oh, I don't know where it came from but apparently\nit's for you. So it's yours now."\n\nAnd I can also tell when there are people there who are going to\nchallenge me and say, "What you're saying is not true because of this\nor because of that." And that's when it goes back to "You've got to\nbegin to understand how we're related and I want to show you\nsomething." And they fight real hard---it seems to me--like it's the\nother side or it's the balance. Or maybe it's the dark side that's\nfighting it. It's saying "Don't do this." You want to do it this way\nbecause those people are going to take you. It doesn't matter. I'm\nready. But before I go I have to make sure that they know what this\nreally is all about. And I'm going to teach them how to be a human\nbeing. And I don't know. It takes me. I've experienced it in concerts,\nwhere I feel like I wasn't really there. The music was going on its\nown. It was coming out of my flutes. I wasn't really there. It was\ntaking me.\n\nDW: I hear that when I listen to your music.\n\nRC: I don't know where it comes from. People say, "Show me how to do\nthat." I say I don't know. All I can do is show you how to play the\nflute. It comes from you. It's inside of you already. You know how to\ndo this. I'm just showing you how to make the tool work.\n\nDW: It comes through you.\n\nRC: It does. You know that's when people see them on stage with me.\nThey say, "Who are those two guys that were behind you?" I say I\ndon't know. I don't know. What do they look like? Some times it 's an\nold man. Sometimes it's the two young native guys with their business\nsuits. I said, "Do they have two brown briefcases? "Well, no, but they\nhad something in their hands." "I know what it is. Is it this\nsymbol?" "...sort of like that. And they were holding it." And then\nthey hold it out to the people.\n\nThe only way I can explain it is that we're a part of this huge body of\nknowledge, awareness, wisdom, whatever it might be ---and we're like\nthe nerve-endings of it. And we're experiencing things for this huge\nawareness and then when we go back we take the knowledge that we've\nexperienced here with us and say: "This is what we've learned there.\nI've learned this for you." So in the life experience, it is very\nimportant to make sure everything you do counts because when you go\nback, you're going impart all of this experience to yourself. It's\nstupid sounding but that's the only way I can explain it. People say\n"That's too simple." No, that's really involved. That's the\nsimplest way I can explain it. I am a part of something much larger than\nanything I can even imagine, and I'm only a feeler---as all of you are.\nSome get it. Some don't.\n\nIt's not insignificant but what I was shown or what I became aware of\nwas that even in my own life, even though I feel that it's\ninsignificant, everything that I experience here is very critical for\nallowing this being to understand the enormity of itself. And its at\nthat point that I realized that what I do here is very important. And I\nshouldn't take a lot of things that I had been doing up until that time\nvery lightly or live my life carelessly, and it also showed me what it\nmeant when I would be allowed to leave from here. But it wasn't my\ntime. It was only showing me because I had accidentally tripped on the\ncarpet and come there but I couldn't come through and stay.\n\nI talk to them (the Natives) when I need assurance. A lot of\nperformances are very difficult and they have a way for me to call them\nand I'll call them and it just happens. I don't know. There's a\nreason. We won't know right now. This is only a part of it. There's a\nreason for all of this. They're showing me as well as you. So I'm here\ntoo for some reason I don't totally understand. Why am I here in\nCanada, because I'm not getting paid that much to do what I'm doing\nhere, but there's a reason, a purpose for my being here at this point\nin time. I don't know what it is. I may know later when something\nfinally comes together. I don't know. Who knows?\n\nThe physical package is not the end. You go to this place. That's what\nI know. and there's no pain. It's a transition that's really neat.\nYou go and you become All Life again and you realize what you are and\nthen you come back. That's the only way I can explain it. That's the\nonly way I know to give it very simply. Most people say, "That's too\neasy." NO, it's not.\n\nMy name...What I do.. it's just part of the whole spectrum of what we\ndo in the world. When I started this whole thing, after all of that, the\nsymbol came, two people came, and then things began happening. And then\nI would play but it wasn't just the music. There was something else\ntaking, pushing me toward the philosophic thing. But the philosophy\nwasn't my own. It was a philosophy that was bringing all of these\ndiverse perspectives down to one thing. That symbol is related to the\nwhole thing.\n\nI even talked to Jim Pepper about it and he said, "I don't know. Keep\ndoing what you're doing and see what happens." He was another\nmusician. Kaw Indian, passed on now. We talked a whole lot about\nsurvival and survival as a Native in modern culture and being a musician\nand when I went to this place to work with him, I took just two flutes\nand I felt totally underequipped but he was the one who said "No. No.\nDon't get your horn. Just see what you can do with that instrument."\nDon't set it aside because there is a reason why you brought them and\nthere's a reason why you want to play them and there's a reason why\nyou want to play them in the context of this music. So see what happens.\nJust keep doing it. It'll eventually get there and I feel that I'm\nstill trying to get there.\n\nI haven't reached the state of Nirvana with it yet. I'm still learning\nwhat it 's teaching me. And even for concerts that I do. it just ---I\ndon't feel that I've reached it yet. But people have come up and\nremarked on it and how it's moved them and I say, "It's not me." It\njust leaves me standing there going, "Where did that come from?" I\ndon't know. but it feels like I am totally aware of what I am and what\nI'm doing, but something is speaking for me and my voice comes out. And\neven my voice changes at that point---which I've learned to understand\nnow. It's speaking through me. I don't know what I'm doing. All I\nknow is what comes out.\n\nDW: You're speaking from your heart.\n\nRC: It comes out and it impacts someone. I don't choose that. And\nthat's all you can say.\n\nDW: An interesting thing about what you do, too, is that you tie in with\nnature and that makes things even more whole. I think about the times I\ngo places and I hear your music and people are always touched .\n\nRC: I don't how that works. Go somewhere... I don't know how it comes\nout. You know, there's a scientist looking at it from the perspective\nof understanding sound technology. There isn't anything that is just\nlike any other music except it does something and I don't know how that\nworks. It does something. It changes him and I go, "Well, thank you,\nbut it's just for you." And it could be the same song but it impacts\nindividuals in different ways. How does that work? Listening to a rock\nand roll song that I really like from the 60's brings forth memories of\nactivities to me, but it doesn't impact others. For me it's there, but\nfor others it's gone. "Oh yes, we used to listen to that. It's\nnothing now." "Oh yeah, but don't you remember the history of that?"\n\nDW: You are a wonderful example of what they call "co-creating with\nGod."\n\nRC: I suppose. I don't know. I just do it.\n\nDW: Keep doing it. It's wonderful.\n\nRC: Well, all I can apply to it is---being of service to others.\n\n### Past Life\n\nDW: I understand that you have also been led to discover that your most\nrecent past life was in Germany, as an SS officer. How did you discover\nthat?\n\nRC: The first things that occurred were dreams and awarenesses that I\nwas actually involved in a different cultural community than I was born\ninto. There were awarenesses of where I might have come from or\nawarenesses of activities that impacted me at a certain point in time.\nAnd those were from when I was younger, a child. And then as I got older\nI became more directed about things political, social---almost a whole\nrange that was recurring and trying to remind me of where I had come\nfrom or where I had been before and where I needed to be now. Of course,\nwhen you're much younger, much of that understanding isn't there yet.\n\nI had a very significant dream that awakened my awareness to the fact\nthat I used to suppress people. And I was also a Catholic. But there was\na power that was much greater than I was that was forcing me, and\nenforcing me to be what I was until I got shot in the head.\n\nDW: What kind of dreams did you have as a child? What are the first\nthings you remember?\n\nRC: Well, the first ones actually dealt with hearing the sounds of\npeople screaming, crying, and being sad, and then having dreams of\nchildren that I knew at one time, but really didn't know, but they were\nthere...attempting to communicate with me, but I didn't have any\nunderstanding of their language or what they were attempting to do in\nthe dreams. They weren't foreboding. They were more like: "Come here.\nCome here. We're going to show you something."\n\nDW: Did they show you something?\n\nRC: No, because I would wake up about that time---and those would happen\ninfrequently. And then, I experienced dreams of houses that I'd been\nin. One in particular, which is kind of German in nature, because it was\nconnected to a barn which is adjacent to a larger building, and I\ndidn't know what it was all about. But I'm still looking for that\nplace because I had to draw it on paper so I could find it. And there is\none thing in one of the window sills: a secret place where I hid\nsomething. And I need to find the house so I can find that piece and\nthen I will connect everything.\n\nDW: Do you know what town it is in?\n\nRC: No. There are real close things in both the United States and in\nGermany that point towards the direction but I haven't found the exact\none yet. So it's out there somewhere.\n\nDW: When did you begin to suspect that these were actually related to a\nprevious existence?\n\nRC: Well, that wasn't until the mid-80's, but it was after doing a lot\nof reading and working with people who had discussed or talked with us\nabout near-death experiences, the Kubler Ross series, then working with\nJethro Klauss (author of *Back to Eden*) and other herbalists who spent\ntheir time dreaming and of course writings by people like David Chatwin\nand others who had had these experiences..... and I thought "Well this\nstuff sounds like things that I'd experienced when I was growing up."\n\nA friend of mine from Flagstaff, AZ, sent me a helmet that he brought\nhome from Germany at the end of WW II and he said, "Here, you can have\nthis old thing." And I was holding it and looking at it and it was such\na neat thing. It was so heavy. Black. Big insignia and stuff on it. And\nin the inside it had a leather liner. It was a beautiful piece of steel\nwork. And then stuff started happening to me after that. It was like the\nfocus that allowed me to understand what I was before.\n\nI forced upon people a way to remove them from their culture. And I\nforced people not to be who they were. So what am I now? I am learning\nin this life what it means to be a person living in their own homeland\nwith no place to identify with. I am an American Indian and by God,\n"You will learn what it means to be invisible." And I'm enjoying it\nnow because I understand now what my responsibility is---to know what it\nmeans to be nobody.\n\nBut I think the most telling was traveling to Germany one year---to\nsouthern Germany---and then having these feelings of being in very\nfamiliar territory and knowing that I had been there before---and then\nbeing able to negotiate in certain cities that we visited. "I used to\nlive here at one time. I KNOW I DID." So I began to get more seriously\ninvolved in trying to find out what my psychic/psychologic---other than\nphysiological---relationship was to all those dreams and things that had\noccurred to me.\n\nAnd at a point the dreams became clear that I was actually a German at\none time. I had become involved in the National Socialist movement in\nthe thirties. And yes, I grew up with all the people that were in my\ndreams. And they were my neighbors and friends that I had known at one\ntime, but then I had become a member of the SS and that's what they\nwere reminding me of---that we are all involved in this common humanity\nand this is what I had done in my other awareness, my other life. So it\nis now very clear why I'm a member of a cultural community that's\nregarded as fairly invisible in the United States. And the hardships\nthat naturally come from being scapegoated in that way are the things\nthat I'm now learning about what I have done before. So I'm back. I'm\nlearning what it means to be invisible.\n\nDW: What year was it that you went to Germany and felt that it was\nsomeplace you'd been.\n\nRC: This was the late 70's or early 80's . I forget exact dates, but\nwe had gone to do concert performances and to visit with friends that I\nhad met in NY years before, to put together a touring schedule that\nwould go through different places and represent an aspect of American\nIndian culture. But instead this happened. So that was more important, I\nthink, than going there to perform and represent native culture. I have\ntalked to the family's grandmother and she said, "Let me tell you a\nstory." And she related to me about the time before the thirties,\nduring WW I and afterwards, when she said, "We were once Jewish people\nand our name was Jewish and we changed it at the end of the war, because\nwe knew there were more problems coming in our\nhomeland--politically--which would impact everyone directly.\n\nThis was the Fuchs family. I had met them in Woodstock, NY. I had gone\nthere for a music workshop---Karl Berger's Creative Music Studio---and\nI met them because they were visiting, and I had a talk with them and\nthey said, "Come to Germany. You'll have fun there. We'll show you\naround." And then I discussed my situation with the Grandmother and\nwith Paul Fuchs himself and he said, "Oh I don't know. That's a hard\none. Many people come back doing or saying things like that, but the way\nyou're talking about it is very different." I said, "Yes, I feel like\nI come from here. I feel like this is my homeland and this is where I\nonce was , but I was this (a SS officer) and I was involved in that\npolitical activity which was happening during WW II and I need to know\nmore about it."\n\nDW: Did you get anything about your name or when you lived or died?\n\nRC: I did have it at one time and I'm trying to track down all of that\nbecause I had written down my name and the community where I had once\nlived. I was talking with a woman who lived in Bad Kissingen and we\ndiscussed a little bit about it, but in the middle of it she cut off all\ncommunication.\n\nI think a telling time was when we spent a day at the Chiem See way down\nin the south near the Swiss and Italian borders. We were there just to\nvisit and go out on a tour and picnic, but we spent the night in a town\nnearby and this dream came that was very very telling. I mean it was\nalmost to the letter a real awareness of, "This is who you are and this\nis why you're where you're at now and you've got to learn this.\nBecause this is what you did."\n\nI do know that I was shot in the head and I died and they took all the\npapers I had on me. That's an awareness I've always had. And I've\nalways considered that the person I was there was also a person who\nreally loved music and participated in a lot of the seasonal activities\nthat occurred in his own homeland. So he was closely tied to the musical\nculture of his own people and then that happened: the drawing away of\nself and becoming this ---I don't know if it was an evil person---but I\ndo know that in that entity, I was a very spiritual person.\n\nBut we were also fighting that dialog that was being given to us by the\nthird Reich and their motives in the world. "You don't do that!" But\nthere was no way for me to physically challenge any of that because it\nwasn't my place. We were very stratified as a military culture at that\npoint. And I even talked with the Fuchs' about that enormous power to\nbe able to force people to change the whole perspective of their lives\nand become something else--a something which is very, very dangerous.\n\nI see that even now working in this culture, where there are certain\nmovements of either extreme militarism or confrontive cultural\nperspectives on things where we deal with political stereotypes or\nstratification of our way against someone else's---trying to get at the\nword. I don't like that. Because I've been there before. I know what\nit does and I know what it can create and I know that then you become\nyour own enemy.\n\nI also realize that's the reason why I am the way I am now: to learn\nwhat it means to be one of those people who are oppressed like I was\noppressing others. So I have to learn that lesson but I'm also doing\nthe other thing, too. While I'm learning the lesson, I am also giving\nback, I think. It's tying itself together and as I get older and older\nI'm starting to find these awarenesses--you know, it's all linked....I\nhave no real power, but the power that I do have is only in the message\nthat's being given and in that, I'm being guided very carefully. I'm\nalways being warned not to make it a personal adventure because that's\nnot my providence.\n\nDW: When were you born?\n\nRC: 1946\n\nDW: That was very soon after the war. You must have cycled right back.\n\nRC: Yes, I feel that I completed a cycle almost immediately---but\ninstead of being in Germany, I came here and I became involved in the\nentity that I am now to learn what it means to be politically and\nsocially objectified.\n\nDW: Have you ever had a past life regression?\n\nRC: No, I've never have done that. There was someone who attempted to\ndo that but apparently he wasn't a real hypnotist and it didn't really\nwork in the way that I was hoping it would turn out. But you know there\nare things around me that I know about, that occur at certain points in\ntime, in relationships that I develop with other people that sort of\npoint to, "This is what you used to be because you know this stuff and\nnow you're this," but they are teaching mechanisms that I have put on\nin my life right now.\n\nEven what I do with the flute, it's like---why do I say this stuff? I\nmean it's not me but it comes out of me. It's an insistence that I've\ngot to do this. This is something that I have to do, so I do it---not\ntrying to understand it better---but I have to do this, so I do it.\n\nWhen all of that stuff just started pouring out, I talked to a number of\nmedicine people about it and they said, "Only thing I can tell you is\nkeep doing what you're doing and see where it leads you. Write\neverything down, because somebody, somewhere, will contact you that,\n'This is happening to me.' and you've got the key already and they\ncan do it, too."\n\nWhat I've come to be aware of is that there are no American Indians\nanywhere who have an answer. We all do. But we have to access ourselves.\nIt's in us. And all the life experiences that we carry within our being\nare all based on traveling through time immemorial. Down through time\nand all those stories are in us but how do we get them out? I don't\nknow. I do know that dreams help. The way that I organize who I am\nhelps. What I do creatively helps. All of this is linked---and it's\nreally amazing. It's like I'm living in my dream. I could walk around\nlike some stupid person, giggling and chuckling all the time. I'm so\nhappy. But I've learned not to do that, because people will say, "What\nthe hell are you doing? Wipe the grin off your face."\n\nDW: Who would you be now if you'd not had this experience?\n\nRC: I probably would have continued down the same road I was headed at\nthat time and I probably would have ended up a drug user or an\nalcoholic---totally outside of myself, entirely externalized. I probably\nwould have stayed in the military and died an alcoholic, not really\nunderstanding myself. There was a reason for all of it and even now when\nI mull it over and consider it, it's like I was given a gift. I was\nchosen for some reason. I don't know why. And that's what I don't\nunderstand, but I feel like even now with the two entities that guide me\n--- it's not my place to begin to understand that, just to do what it\nis that I was given to do, so it acts through me. But when it takes me,\nit takes me.\n\nSo I listen to what I'm doing too and I'm always amazed at how my\nthinking tends to go in a certain direction at that point and it takes\nit that way and then people come later and say, "This is exactly why I\nneeded to be here." And I say, "I don't know. It's not me." I\ndon't know of any better way to explain this. All I can say is that the\npower of life works through me and I have no control over it, so I'm\nnot the spiritual person, but I'm only a vehicle for whatever it is\nthat we all need. I don't know. I don't know.\n\nDW: How do you see the relationship between the NDE and your creativity?\n\nRC: I think a lot of it became very directed. Before that time, the\ncreativity was more let's say, physically oriented---to make money or\nwhatever. And even at that time I hadn't really thought about anything\nthat would be of assistance to other people. I was still thinking\nprimarily of my own self, as an ego bound person. And then when this\nhappened, something changed and all of a sudden I was directed towards a\nmethodology that I had no real skill for. Then I started making flutes\nand became very interested in sound and sound technology and even after\nbeing released from the military, I became very much aware of how sound\naffects other people and how certain music will create certain emotional\nresponses and bring them out of people in their own way, and I found\nthat using sound in this manner could even damage people or hurt them.\n\nThen the flutes came, and wanting to play these instruments, and then\ndiscovering that sound, and then being totally amazed by the sound that\nI was producing and how it affected other people and even animals. And I\nthought, "This thing has power. And I think I am supposed to do this."\n\n<tt> RC has a degree from the University of Arizona (Tucson) in American\nIndian Studies and Cultural Anthropology, dealing with spiritual,\nreligious and cultural aspects of American Indian survival into the 21st\ncentury.

Would you describe\nthat experience?</p>\n\n<p>RC: I was involved in a traffic accident with two other people. We were\non our way to work in San Diego, California, over on Coronado Island, in\n1970. I was lying down in the back seat, trying to get some more rest\nbefore we got to our job site. We came around this corner and a Cadillac\npulled out in front of us and there wasn&#39;t enough time to hit the\nbrakes or anything. We were going 35 miles per hour and WHAM, we hit the\nback of this car and I flew forward, face on, into the back of the\npassenger seat in front of me and then I fell back down. It apparently\nwas enough of a trauma to begin to impact me but I wasn&#39;t aware of it.</p>\n\n<p>I got out of the car and a state highway patrolman was standing there.\nHe said, &ldquo;No, no, you&#39;ve got to lie down. You&#39;re really injured.&rdquo; I\ncouldn&#39;t feel anything wrong. He continued, &ldquo;Just sit down here on the\ncurb. You&#39;ve got to wait until the ambulance comes.&rdquo; And we were\nwaiting and then I stood up again and he said, &ldquo;No, you can &#39;t stand\nbecause you&#39;re very injured.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I feel fine.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;No,\nI&#39;d rather have you sit down.&rdquo; So on my way to sitting back down\nagain, I guess I collapsed. The last thing I remember was the officer\nsaying, &ldquo;Don&#39;t get blood on my uniform. I just had it dry cleaned.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Then I blacked out. It started like a bunch of little squares growing in\nfront of my eyes and I was out for a while, but it felt to me like\nseconds. Then there was this feeling like a tingling, and a real long\nnoise, an audible buzzing noise, which was kind of like the sound a\nlocust makes&mdash;when all of a sudden the world opened up and there was\nthis huge immense light everywhere and it wasn&#39;t like clouds or\nanything familiar. It was just this huge bright awareness. And I could\nfeel that I was everything and to me it felt like I was there for\nminutes&mdash;just being awe-inspired by looking out and something in my\nmind was telling me, &ldquo;You are all this. You are all this.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I was seeing light but it was like being in clouds when I&#39;m flying in\nairplanes&mdash;so I like to do that now. A bright day, flying through the\nclouds at 30,000 feet and it&#39;s like that. But you&#39;re not in the plane.\nYou&#39;re in the clouds. And you&#39;re not falling. So it feels like you&#39;re\nbeing held in outer space. You know, it just holds you and you become a\npart of it. It&#39;s like being a giant marshmallow. It&#39;s warm. It&#39;s\nenclosing. There&#39;s no hunger. There&#39;s no sorrow. No emotions except\npure awareness. Everything opens&mdash;as they say, the third eye.\nEverything. All your senses are &mdash;you are totally in it and it just\nhappens, and it is like,&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; and I knew in my mind that everything\nthat I was witnessing or experiencing in my life was me and it felt\nwarm. I felt very comfortable and I was standing. I now know I was\nstanding because I could see myself standing and feel myself being in\nthat space and being drawn in and&mdash; &ldquo;It&#39;s not your time, why are you\nhere? Now it&#39;s time to go back.&rdquo; And I thought, &ldquo;There must be\nmore.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, it&#39;s time to go back.&rdquo; It was like me, speaking to\nmyself.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s the only thing I can say to put it very simply so\npeople can understand it.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t want to come back, but when I woke up, I was lying in an\nambulance and the policeman was by me and he said, &ldquo;I told you. Now\nyou&#39;re awake, but I told you &#39;Don&#39;t pass out.&#39; Now I have to go home\nand get my uniform dry cleaned again.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry. I just\npassed out for a moment.&rdquo; He said &ldquo;No. It was about a half an hour.\nYou almost died on us.&rdquo; I said &ldquo;No. All I did was hit the back of the\nseat in this car.&rdquo; And I noticed I was all bandaged up and I said\n&ldquo;What&#39;s all this stuff?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Well, there&#39;s a huge gash.\nYour teeth are here in this cup and you were knocked out, and we think\nyou have some back damage and you might have some broken ribs.&rdquo; And I\nsaid, &ldquo;No&ndash;not possible. I just passed out for a moment. I&#39;ll find\nsomeone to dry clean your uniform for you. At least I can do that.&rdquo; He\nsaid, &ldquo;No. They&#39;re going to take you to the hospital now.&rdquo; &mdash;and\nthey did.</p>\n\n<p>He said it was 30 minutes. I thought it was the snap of a finger&mdash;just\na flash &ndash;just an instant&ndash;I saw this huge thing. All I know is that I\nknow what&#39;s over there now and I&#39;m very secure in the fact that I\ndon&#39;t have to be afraid.</p>\n\n<p>DW: You&#39;re not afraid to die now?</p>\n\n<p>RC: No.</p>\n\n<p>DW: Were you afraid before?</p>\n\n<p>RC: Probably. I think most people are. But I know now what I am.</p>\n\n<p>After it was over, I thought my world had ended. I had split my lip\nopen. There was significant nerve damage through my upper lip and cheek,\nso I could no longer play the brass instruments. After it all healed up\nand all the stitches were taken out on the inside, I realized that the\ndoctor had put the teeth back the way he thought they should belong and\nthey were all out of order. So now my embouchure was destroyed. The\nmusculature was destroyed. I&#39;m still trying to play the trumpet,\nbecause that was my dream, that&#39;s my sound.</p>\n\n<p>But I got home and I spent a whole year moping around, trying to get\nmyself back. And we went to Santa Fe, NM, and I found a man who was\nwalking around at the Indian Market with a basket full of flutes and he\nwas a flutemaker from San Diego by the name of Oliver W. Jones, who is a\ndoctor on genetics. His hobby was making flutes. So we talked to him a\nlittle bit and we traded some beadwork that we had for the flutes and\nkind of looked at them and hung them on the wall. They were nice\nlooking.</p>\n\n<p>And then one day my friend says, &ldquo;Here, take these things. Spiders and\nbugs are living in them. They&#39;re nice. Why don&#39;t you try to play them\nand see what you can do with them?&rdquo; So that started the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m here on a mission. I&#39;m here on a job to do something, so when I&#39;m\nthrough I&#39;ll go back and I don&#39;t have that fear because as I talk with\nelders about it they say, &ldquo;It sounds like you&#39;ve gone there and done\nthis&mdash;but here&#39;s the secret: You can&#39;t choose to go. You&#39;ve got to\nlet it come in its own time because you&#39;re here for a reason. There&#39;s\na purpose in why you&#39;re here and you have to understand that before\nyou&#39;re allowed to go back.</p>\n\n<p>When I had that accident I was told that it&#39;s not my time. And what was\nintuited to me was my time will come but first I have to do this. And\nall these things are in my mind. And I can&#39;t explain it and there&#39;s no\nreal way to explain what it felt like to be there, but it was WONDERFUL.\nSo I can&#39;t wait to die&mdash;because I know what the gift is.</p>\n\n<p>What I intuit from that is that I am one of the nerve endings in this\nhuge entity of everything that exists, the cosmos, everything. I am one\nof those little nerve endings and I am experiencing for this huge\nawareness what it means to be me or you or you or you or this or that.\nAnd when we all leave from here we all go back to ourselves and we say,\n&quot;That was fun. This is what I experienced.&rdquo; And maybe it will say\n&ldquo;God, I&#39;m wonderful. Go do it again.&rdquo; So like a giant kid you say,\n&ldquo;Ok. What am I going to do this time?&rdquo; And that&#39;s the only thing I\ncan think of to explain what it means.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s like reincarnation&mdash;it&#39;s a different experience the next time.\nSo you&#39;ve got to make the most of being here now. You&#39;ve got to live\nin your dream and smile with a shit-eating smile on your face and walk\naround like you know everything. We are still children. Learn to love\nyourself. That&#39;s where it&#39;s all at. And in that way, you&#39;ll love your\nlife. We are all varied and different because our life experiences are\nnot all the same and they&#39;re not meant to be. You&#39;re here to become of\nservice to others and that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about&mdash;to become of\nservice to others.</p>\n\n<h3>Spirit Guides</h3>\n\n<p>But there are certain things that happen now in my life which make me\nknow I&#39;m being guided, because there are two people who come to me in\nmy dreams and they&#39;ve given me symbols that I use now.</p>\n\n<p>DW: Do you know who they are?</p>\n\n<p>RC: No. They look like two native men to me. They wear business suits\nand carry briefcases, but they have braids. They are younger. They say:\n&ldquo;Now you&#39;re a part of us&mdash;but you have to spread this symbol all over\nthe world because you belong to us now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>DW: What is the symbol?</p>\n\n<p>RC: It is a circle with four quadrants, but the one they gave me has\nmountains on it. And I drew that one too. It has mountains and an eagle\nfeather in the middle&ndash;which really isn&#39;t an eagle feather. It&#39;s sort\nof a dream of change. But it&#39;s a symbol of something&hellip; some power or\nsomething.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s done on white paper, with embossing. And these mountains are\nsupposed to be the space that we all live in and this is the physical\nplane. This is the message, the dream. These are the directions that we\nare suppose to be aware of. This is the journey that we&#39;re on. But the\ndream is always primary. These blank spaces are also important because\nit&#39;s three-dimensional. There&#39;s a line or trail that comes out and\ngoes away. That&#39;s the path that we&#39;re born into and then we leave on.\nSo those parts you don&#39;t see. These are roads of life experience. It&#39;s\nlike a figure eight but it moves so the figure eight is moving too. So\nyour symbol is always in action one way or another. The areas in here\nare for storing information&hellip;. physical, spiritual. That&#39;s called\nATOKA.</p>\n\n<p>DW: What does that mean?</p>\n\n<p>RC: I don&#39;t speak Lakota, but a lady said, &ldquo;This is a word we don&#39;t\nuse any more. Where did you get that word?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It just came,&rdquo;\nand I showed her this symbol and she said, &ldquo;That&#39;s what you&#39;re\nsupposed to do.&rdquo; She said it means something sacred, unexplainable. &ldquo;I\ndon&#39;t even know what the word means but we used it like &#39;Wapunkanta&#39;\nwhich means great mystery,&rdquo; and that was the other part of it. She said\n&ldquo;What I do know is that we know that we came from somewhere else and\nwe&#39;re on this journey. It&#39;s spiritual , it&#39;s physical, it&#39;s\nphilosophical. It&#39;s everything at once. But we&#39;ve lost the mentality\nto understand that part. I don&#39;t know where you got this word. Nobody\nknows this word except Lokota Holy men.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>So I told her about these two young guys that come to me that have long\nhair and business suits and everything. And she said: &ldquo;Do they look\nlike this?&rdquo; And I said , &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And she described these different\npeople to me and she said &ldquo;They are like twins, but they are also hero\nbrothers and they&#39;re guardians. They are giving you something. It&#39;s\nvery, very spiritual and sacred and you&#39;ll know the rest, but keep all\nof this stuff because somewhere you&#39;re supposed to do something with\nit.&rdquo; And that&#39;s all I know.</p>\n\n<p>So I still have the original drawing and the story that came to me in\nthat dream. And then the subsequent dream when they gave me this one and\nthe story that goes with this. And the only thing they told me, as they\nwere peeling the paper off the back and sticking it on trash cans and\nwindows, was: &ldquo;You&#39;re gonna spread this thing all over the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m supposed to make it physical and then give it to people. So I&#39;m\nstill in the process of getting that done and it&#39;s been about 12 years\nnow, but the Natives are still here&mdash;even when I&#39;m working. And the\nsymbol is always with me. I use it all the time. It&#39;s on everything I\ndo. So they&#39;re helping me to get this message across.</p>\n\n<p>DW: If there&#39;s a way to save the world and to bridge the gap between\npeople, it&#39;s through&hellip;.</p>\n\n<p>RC: self-awareness and the awareness that we&#39;re all connected\nphysiologically. It&#39;s a very simple concept. Why people don&#39;t get it\nis beyond me because if I know this, you should know this too. Why do\npeople fear?</p>\n\n<p>I know the two people that follow me say, &ldquo;Everything that will come to\nyou is a gift and make sure that you take it. But when you refuse a gift\nthe first time, it won&#39;t come back to you and then you&#39;re on your\nown.&rdquo; But now I realize what the gift is. It&#39;s anything. It could be\nmoney. It could be stuff. But it comes to me, because it&#39;s not for me.\nIt comes to me and then later someone always comes and says &ldquo;I really\nneed this&rdquo; and I say &ldquo;I have this and I don&#39;t need it and I want you\nto have it.&rdquo; So I&#39;ve sort of become a go between.</p>\n\n<p>And even what I do musically is that way, too. It doesn&#39;t belong to me.\nIt moves through me because that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to be doing . And\nwhen I do that and give it freely to others then it&#39;s now theirs. It&#39;s\nthe gift. And I have no control over it. I mean. It takes me, too. I&#39;ll\nbe doing these performances and lectures and suddenly I&#39;ll be somewhere\nelse and my mind will be shut, but I&#39;m talking about something I&#39;ve\nnever done before, and I think, &ldquo;Where does this come from? I&#39;ve never\ntaught this stuff before and why am I saying it now?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Or I&#39;ll be talking and then it will change and I&#39;ll zero in on\nsomeone, and I won&#39;t physically look at them but I will suddenly begin\nspeaking about something and then they say, &ldquo;That&#39;s exactly why I came\nhere.&rdquo; And I go, &ldquo;Oh, I don&#39;t know where it came from but apparently\nit&#39;s for you. So it&#39;s yours now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And I can also tell when there are people there who are going to\nchallenge me and say, &ldquo;What you&#39;re saying is not true because of this\nor because of that.&rdquo; And that&#39;s when it goes back to &ldquo;You&#39;ve got to\nbegin to understand how we&#39;re related and I want to show you\nsomething.&rdquo; And they fight real hard&mdash;it seems to me&ndash;like it&#39;s the\nother side or it&#39;s the balance. Or maybe it&#39;s the dark side that&#39;s\nfighting it. It&#39;s saying &ldquo;Don&#39;t do this.&rdquo; You want to do it this way\nbecause those people are going to take you. It doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m\nready. But before I go I have to make sure that they know what this\nreally is all about. And I&#39;m going to teach them how to be a human\nbeing. And I don&#39;t know. It takes me. I&#39;ve experienced it in concerts,\nwhere I feel like I wasn&#39;t really there. The music was going on its\nown. It was coming out of my flutes. I wasn&#39;t really there. It was\ntaking me.</p>\n\n<p>DW: I hear that when I listen to your music.</p>\n\n<p>RC: I don&#39;t know where it comes from. People say, &ldquo;Show me how to do\nthat.&rdquo; I say I don&#39;t know. All I can do is show you how to play the\nflute. It comes from you. It&#39;s inside of you already. You know how to\ndo this. I&#39;m just showing you how to make the tool work.</p>\n\n<p>DW: It comes through you.</p>\n\n<p>RC: It does. You know that&#39;s when people see them on stage with me.\nThey say, &ldquo;Who are those two guys that were behind you?&rdquo; I say I\ndon&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. What do they look like? Some times it &#39;s an\nold man. Sometimes it&#39;s the two young native guys with their business\nsuits. I said, &ldquo;Do they have two brown briefcases? &quot;Well, no, but they\nhad something in their hands.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know what it is. Is it this\nsymbol?&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;sort of like that. And they were holding it.&rdquo; And then\nthey hold it out to the people.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can explain it is that we&#39;re a part of this huge body of\nknowledge, awareness, wisdom, whatever it might be &mdash;and we&#39;re like\nthe nerve-endings of it. And we&#39;re experiencing things for this huge\nawareness and then when we go back we take the knowledge that we&#39;ve\nexperienced here with us and say: &ldquo;This is what we&#39;ve learned there.\nI&#39;ve learned this for you.&rdquo; So in the life experience, it is very\nimportant to make sure everything you do counts because when you go\nback, you&#39;re going impart all of this experience to yourself. It&#39;s\nstupid sounding but that&#39;s the only way I can explain it. People say\n&ldquo;That&#39;s too simple.&rdquo; No, that&#39;s really involved. That&#39;s the\nsimplest way I can explain it. I am a part of something much larger than\nanything I can even imagine, and I&#39;m only a feeler&mdash;as all of you are.\nSome get it. Some don&#39;t.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not insignificant but what I was shown or what I became aware of\nwas that even in my own life, even though I feel that it&#39;s\ninsignificant, everything that I experience here is very critical for\nallowing this being to understand the enormity of itself. And its at\nthat point that I realized that what I do here is very important. And I\nshouldn&#39;t take a lot of things that I had been doing up until that time\nvery lightly or live my life carelessly, and it also showed me what it\nmeant when I would be allowed to leave from here. But it wasn&#39;t my\ntime. It was only showing me because I had accidentally tripped on the\ncarpet and come there but I couldn&#39;t come through and stay.</p>\n\n<p>I talk to them (the Natives) when I need assurance. A lot of\nperformances are very difficult and they have a way for me to call them\nand I&#39;ll call them and it just happens. I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a\nreason. We won&#39;t know right now. This is only a part of it. There&#39;s a\nreason for all of this. They&#39;re showing me as well as you. So I&#39;m here\ntoo for some reason I don&#39;t totally understand. Why am I here in\nCanada, because I&#39;m not getting paid that much to do what I&#39;m doing\nhere, but there&#39;s a reason, a purpose for my being here at this point\nin time. I don&#39;t know what it is. I may know later when something\nfinally comes together. I don&#39;t know. Who knows?</p>\n\n<p>The physical package is not the end. You go to this place. That&#39;s what\nI know. and there&#39;s no pain. It&#39;s a transition that&#39;s really neat.\nYou go and you become All Life again and you realize what you are and\nthen you come back. That&#39;s the only way I can explain it. That&#39;s the\nonly way I know to give it very simply. Most people say, &ldquo;That&#39;s too\neasy.&rdquo; NO, it&#39;s not.</p>\n\n<p>My name&hellip;What I do.. it&#39;s just part of the whole spectrum of what we\ndo in the world. When I started this whole thing, after all of that, the\nsymbol came, two people came, and then things began happening. And then\nI would play but it wasn&#39;t just the music. There was something else\ntaking, pushing me toward the philosophic thing. But the philosophy\nwasn&#39;t my own. It was a philosophy that was bringing all of these\ndiverse perspectives down to one thing. That symbol is related to the\nwhole thing.</p>\n\n<p>I even talked to Jim Pepper about it and he said, &ldquo;I don&#39;t know. Keep\ndoing what you&#39;re doing and see what happens.&rdquo; He was another\nmusician. Kaw Indian, passed on now. We talked a whole lot about\nsurvival and survival as a Native in modern culture and being a musician\nand when I went to this place to work with him, I took just two flutes\nand I felt totally underequipped but he was the one who said &ldquo;No. No.\nDon&#39;t get your horn. Just see what you can do with that instrument.&rdquo;\nDon&#39;t set it aside because there is a reason why you brought them and\nthere&#39;s a reason why you want to play them and there&#39;s a reason why\nyou want to play them in the context of this music. So see what happens.\nJust keep doing it. It&#39;ll eventually get there and I feel that I&#39;m\nstill trying to get there.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#39;t reached the state of Nirvana with it yet. I&#39;m still learning\nwhat it &#39;s teaching me. And even for concerts that I do. it just &mdash;I\ndon&#39;t feel that I&#39;ve reached it yet. But people have come up and\nremarked on it and how it&#39;s moved them and I say, &ldquo;It&#39;s not me.&rdquo; It\njust leaves me standing there going, &ldquo;Where did that come from?&rdquo; I\ndon&#39;t know. but it feels like I am totally aware of what I am and what\nI&#39;m doing, but something is speaking for me and my voice comes out. And\neven my voice changes at that point&mdash;which I&#39;ve learned to understand\nnow. It&#39;s speaking through me. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. All I\nknow is what comes out.</p>\n\n<p>DW: You&#39;re speaking from your heart.</p>\n\n<p>RC: It comes out and it impacts someone. I don&#39;t choose that. And\nthat&#39;s all you can say.</p>\n\n<p>DW: An interesting thing about what you do, too, is that you tie in with\nnature and that makes things even more whole. I think about the times I\ngo places and I hear your music and people are always touched .</p>\n\n<p>RC: I don&#39;t how that works. Go somewhere&hellip; I don&#39;t know how it comes\nout. You know, there&#39;s a scientist looking at it from the perspective\nof understanding sound technology. There isn&#39;t anything that is just\nlike any other music except it does something and I don&#39;t know how that\nworks. It does something. It changes him and I go, &ldquo;Well, thank you,\nbut it&#39;s just for you.&rdquo; And it could be the same song but it impacts\nindividuals in different ways. How does that work? Listening to a rock\nand roll song that I really like from the 60&#39;s brings forth memories of\nactivities to me, but it doesn&#39;t impact others. For me it&#39;s there, but\nfor others it&#39;s gone. &ldquo;Oh yes, we used to listen to that. It&#39;s\nnothing now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh yeah, but don&#39;t you remember the history of that?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>DW: You are a wonderful example of what they call &ldquo;co-creating with\nGod.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>RC: I suppose. I don&#39;t know. I just do it.</p>\n\n<p>DW: Keep doing it. It&#39;s wonderful.</p>\n\n<p>RC: Well, all I can apply to it is&mdash;being of service to others.</p>\n\n<h3>Past Life</h3>\n\n<p>DW: I understand that you have also been led to discover that your most\nrecent past life was in Germany, as an SS officer. How did you discover\nthat?</p>\n\n<p>RC: The first things that occurred were dreams and awarenesses that I\nwas actually involved in a different cultural community than I was born\ninto. There were awarenesses of where I might have come from or\nawarenesses of activities that impacted me at a certain point in time.\nAnd those were from when I was younger, a child. And then as I got older\nI became more directed about things political, social&mdash;almost a whole\nrange that was recurring and trying to remind me of where I had come\nfrom or where I had been before and where I needed to be now. Of course,\nwhen you&#39;re much younger, much of that understanding isn&#39;t there yet.</p>\n\n<p>I had a very significant dream that awakened my awareness to the fact\nthat I used to suppress people. And I was also a Catholic. But there was\na power that was much greater than I was that was forcing me, and\nenforcing me to be what I was until I got shot in the head.</p>\n\n<p>DW: What kind of dreams did you have as a child? What are the first\nthings you remember?</p>\n\n<p>RC: Well, the first ones actually dealt with hearing the sounds of\npeople screaming, crying, and being sad, and then having dreams of\nchildren that I knew at one time, but really didn&#39;t know, but they were\nthere&hellip;attempting to communicate with me, but I didn&#39;t have any\nunderstanding of their language or what they were attempting to do in\nthe dreams. They weren&#39;t foreboding. They were more like: &ldquo;Come here.\nCome here. We&#39;re going to show you something.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>DW: Did they show you something?</p>\n\n<p>RC: No, because I would wake up about that time&mdash;and those would happen\ninfrequently. And then, I experienced dreams of houses that I&#39;d been\nin. One in particular, which is kind of German in nature, because it was\nconnected to a barn which is adjacent to a larger building, and I\ndidn&#39;t know what it was all about. But I&#39;m still looking for that\nplace because I had to draw it on paper so I could find it. And there is\none thing in one of the window sills: a secret place where I hid\nsomething. And I need to find the house so I can find that piece and\nthen I will connect everything.</p>\n\n<p>DW: Do you know what town it is in?</p>\n\n<p>RC: No. There are real close things in both the United States and in\nGermany that point towards the direction but I haven&#39;t found the exact\none yet. So it&#39;s out there somewhere.</p>\n\n<p>DW: When did you begin to suspect that these were actually related to a\nprevious existence?</p>\n\n<p>RC: Well, that wasn&#39;t until the mid-80&#39;s, but it was after doing a lot\nof reading and working with people who had discussed or talked with us\nabout near-death experiences, the Kubler Ross series, then working with\nJethro Klauss (author of <em>Back to Eden</em>) and other herbalists who spent\ntheir time dreaming and of course writings by people like David Chatwin\nand others who had had these experiences&hellip;.. and I thought &ldquo;Well this\nstuff sounds like things that I&#39;d experienced when I was growing up.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A friend of mine from Flagstaff, AZ, sent me a helmet that he brought\nhome from Germany at the end of WW II and he said, &ldquo;Here, you can have\nthis old thing.&rdquo; And I was holding it and looking at it and it was such\na neat thing. It was so heavy. Black. Big insignia and stuff on it. And\nin the inside it had a leather liner. It was a beautiful piece of steel\nwork. And then stuff started happening to me after that. It was like the\nfocus that allowed me to understand what I was before.</p>\n\n<p>I forced upon people a way to remove them from their culture. And I\nforced people not to be who they were. So what am I now? I am learning\nin this life what it means to be a person living in their own homeland\nwith no place to identify with. I am an American Indian and by God,\n&ldquo;You will learn what it means to be invisible.&rdquo; And I&#39;m enjoying it\nnow because I understand now what my responsibility is&mdash;to know what it\nmeans to be nobody.</p>\n\n<p>But I think the most telling was traveling to Germany one year&mdash;to\nsouthern Germany&mdash;and then having these feelings of being in very\nfamiliar territory and knowing that I had been there before&mdash;and then\nbeing able to negotiate in certain cities that we visited. &ldquo;I used to\nlive here at one time. I KNOW I DID.&rdquo; So I began to get more seriously\ninvolved in trying to find out what my psychic&#47;psychologic&mdash;other than\nphysiological&mdash;relationship was to all those dreams and things that had\noccurred to me.</p>\n\n<p>And at a point the dreams became clear that I was actually a German at\none time. I had become involved in the National Socialist movement in\nthe thirties. And yes, I grew up with all the people that were in my\ndreams. And they were my neighbors and friends that I had known at one\ntime, but then I had become a member of the SS and that&#39;s what they\nwere reminding me of&mdash;that we are all involved in this common humanity\nand this is what I had done in my other awareness, my other life. So it\nis now very clear why I&#39;m a member of a cultural community that&#39;s\nregarded as fairly invisible in the United States. And the hardships\nthat naturally come from being scapegoated in that way are the things\nthat I&#39;m now learning about what I have done before. So I&#39;m back. I&#39;m\nlearning what it means to be invisible.</p>\n\n<p>DW: What year was it that you went to Germany and felt that it was\nsomeplace you&#39;d been.</p>\n\n<p>RC: This was the late 70&#39;s or early 80&#39;s . I forget exact dates, but\nwe had gone to do concert performances and to visit with friends that I\nhad met in NY years before, to put together a touring schedule that\nwould go through different places and represent an aspect of American\nIndian culture. But instead this happened. So that was more important, I\nthink, than going there to perform and represent native culture. I have\ntalked to the family&#39;s grandmother and she said, &ldquo;Let me tell you a\nstory.&rdquo; And she related to me about the time before the thirties,\nduring WW I and afterwards, when she said, &ldquo;We were once Jewish people\nand our name was Jewish and we changed it at the end of the war, because\nwe knew there were more problems coming in our\nhomeland&ndash;politically&ndash;which would impact everyone directly.</p>\n\n<p>This was the Fuchs family. I had met them in Woodstock, NY. I had gone\nthere for a music workshop&mdash;Karl Berger&#39;s Creative Music Studio&mdash;and\nI met them because they were visiting, and I had a talk with them and\nthey said, &quot;Come to Germany. You&#39;ll have fun there. We&#39;ll show you\naround.&rdquo; And then I discussed my situation with the Grandmother and\nwith Paul Fuchs himself and he said, &ldquo;Oh I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s a hard\none. Many people come back doing or saying things like that, but the way\nyou&#39;re talking about it is very different.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Yes, I feel like\nI come from here. I feel like this is my homeland and this is where I\nonce was , but I was this (a SS officer) and I was involved in that\npolitical activity which was happening during WW II and I need to know\nmore about it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>DW: Did you get anything about your name or when you lived or died?</p>\n\n<p>RC: I did have it at one time and I&#39;m trying to track down all of that\nbecause I had written down my name and the community where I had once\nlived. I was talking with a woman who lived in Bad Kissingen and we\ndiscussed a little bit about it, but in the middle of it she cut off all\ncommunication.</p>\n\n<p>I think a telling time was when we spent a day at the Chiem See way down\nin the south near the Swiss and Italian borders. We were there just to\nvisit and go out on a tour and picnic, but we spent the night in a town\nnearby and this dream came that was very very telling. I mean it was\nalmost to the letter a real awareness of, &ldquo;This is who you are and this\nis why you&#39;re where you&#39;re at now and you&#39;ve got to learn this.\nBecause this is what you did.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I do know that I was shot in the head and I died and they took all the\npapers I had on me. That&#39;s an awareness I&#39;ve always had. And I&#39;ve\nalways considered that the person I was there was also a person who\nreally loved music and participated in a lot of the seasonal activities\nthat occurred in his own homeland. So he was closely tied to the musical\nculture of his own people and then that happened: the drawing away of\nself and becoming this &mdash;I don&#39;t know if it was an evil person&mdash;but I\ndo know that in that entity, I was a very spiritual person.</p>\n\n<p>But we were also fighting that dialog that was being given to us by the\nthird Reich and their motives in the world. &ldquo;You don&#39;t do that!&rdquo; But\nthere was no way for me to physically challenge any of that because it\nwasn&#39;t my place. We were very stratified as a military culture at that\npoint. And I even talked with the Fuchs&#39; about that enormous power to\nbe able to force people to change the whole perspective of their lives\nand become something else&ndash;a something which is very, very dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>I see that even now working in this culture, where there are certain\nmovements of either extreme militarism or confrontive cultural\nperspectives on things where we deal with political stereotypes or\nstratification of our way against someone else&#39;s&mdash;trying to get at the\nword. I don&#39;t like that. Because I&#39;ve been there before. I know what\nit does and I know what it can create and I know that then you become\nyour own enemy.</p>\n\n<p>I also realize that&#39;s the reason why I am the way I am now: to learn\nwhat it means to be one of those people who are oppressed like I was\noppressing others. So I have to learn that lesson but I&#39;m also doing\nthe other thing, too. While I&#39;m learning the lesson, I am also giving\nback, I think. It&#39;s tying itself together and as I get older and older\nI&#39;m starting to find these awarenesses&ndash;you know, it&#39;s all linked&hellip;.I\nhave no real power, but the power that I do have is only in the message\nthat&#39;s being given and in that, I&#39;m being guided very carefully. I&#39;m\nalways being warned not to make it a personal adventure because that&#39;s\nnot my providence.</p>\n\n<p>DW: When were you born?</p>\n\n<p>RC: 1946</p>\n\n<p>DW: That was very soon after the war. You must have cycled right back.</p>\n\n<p>RC: Yes, I feel that I completed a cycle almost immediately&mdash;but\ninstead of being in Germany, I came here and I became involved in the\nentity that I am now to learn what it means to be politically and\nsocially objectified.</p>\n\n<p>DW: Have you ever had a past life regression?</p>\n\n<p>RC: No, I&#39;ve never have done that. There was someone who attempted to\ndo that but apparently he wasn&#39;t a real hypnotist and it didn&#39;t really\nwork in the way that I was hoping it would turn out. But you know there\nare things around me that I know about, that occur at certain points in\ntime, in relationships that I develop with other people that sort of\npoint to, &ldquo;This is what you used to be because you know this stuff and\nnow you&#39;re this,&rdquo; but they are teaching mechanisms that I have put on\nin my life right now.</p>\n\n<p>Even what I do with the flute, it&#39;s like&mdash;why do I say this stuff? I\nmean it&#39;s not me but it comes out of me. It&#39;s an insistence that I&#39;ve\ngot to do this. This is something that I have to do, so I do it&mdash;not\ntrying to understand it better&mdash;but I have to do this, so I do it.</p>\n\n<p>When all of that stuff just started pouring out, I talked to a number of\nmedicine people about it and they said, &ldquo;Only thing I can tell you is\nkeep doing what you&#39;re doing and see where it leads you. Write\neverything down, because somebody, somewhere, will contact you that,\n&#39;This is happening to me.&#39; and you&#39;ve got the key already and they\ncan do it, too.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>What I&#39;ve come to be aware of is that there are no American Indians\nanywhere who have an answer. We all do. But we have to access ourselves.\nIt&#39;s in us. And all the life experiences that we carry within our being\nare all based on traveling through time immemorial. Down through time\nand all those stories are in us but how do we get them out? I don&#39;t\nknow. I do know that dreams help. The way that I organize who I am\nhelps. What I do creatively helps. All of this is linked&mdash;and it&#39;s\nreally amazing. It&#39;s like I&#39;m living in my dream. I could walk around\nlike some stupid person, giggling and chuckling all the time. I&#39;m so\nhappy. But I&#39;ve learned not to do that, because people will say, &ldquo;What\nthe hell are you doing? Wipe the grin off your face.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>DW: Who would you be now if you&#39;d not had this experience?</p>\n\n<p>RC: I probably would have continued down the same road I was headed at\nthat time and I probably would have ended up a drug user or an\nalcoholic&mdash;totally outside of myself, entirely externalized. I probably\nwould have stayed in the military and died an alcoholic, not really\nunderstanding myself. There was a reason for all of it and even now when\nI mull it over and consider it, it&#39;s like I was given a gift. I was\nchosen for some reason. I don&#39;t know why. And that&#39;s what I don&#39;t\nunderstand, but I feel like even now with the two entities that guide me\n&mdash; it&#39;s not my place to begin to understand that, just to do what it\nis that I was given to do, so it acts through me. But when it takes me,\nit takes me.</p>\n\n<p>So I listen to what I&#39;m doing too and I&#39;m always amazed at how my\nthinking tends to go in a certain direction at that point and it takes\nit that way and then people come later and say, &ldquo;This is exactly why I\nneeded to be here.&rdquo; And I say, &ldquo;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not me.&rdquo; I\ndon&#39;t know of any better way to explain this. All I can say is that the\npower of life works through me and I have no control over it, so I&#39;m\nnot the spiritual person, but I&#39;m only a vehicle for whatever it is\nthat we all need. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>DW: How do you see the relationship between the NDE and your creativity?</p>\n\n<p>RC: I think a lot of it became very directed. Before that time, the\ncreativity was more let&#39;s say, physically oriented&mdash;to make money or\nwhatever. And even at that time I hadn&#39;t really thought about anything\nthat would be of assistance to other people. I was still thinking\nprimarily of my own self, as an ego bound person. And then when this\nhappened, something changed and all of a sudden I was directed towards a\nmethodology that I had no real skill for. Then I started making flutes\nand became very interested in sound and sound technology and even after\nbeing released from the military, I became very much aware of how sound\naffects other people and how certain music will create certain emotional\nresponses and bring them out of people in their own way, and I found\nthat using sound in this manner could even damage people or hurt them.</p>\n\n<p>Then the flutes came, and wanting to play these instruments, and then\ndiscovering that sound, and then being totally amazed by the sound that\nI was producing and how it affected other people and even animals. And I\nthought, &ldquo;This thing has power. And I think I am supposed to do this.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><tt> RC has a degree from the University of Arizona (Tucson) in American\nIndian Studies and Cultural Anthropology, dealing with spiritual,\nreligious and cultural aspects of American Indian survival into the 21st\ncentury.

5	Reflections on Some Spiritual Aspects of Life Threatening Illness	Robert Magrisso, MD	<tt> The following is a transcript of a lecture presented at MEDICAL\nGRAND ROUNDS, EVANSTON (IL) NORTHWESTERN HEALTHCARE, DECEMBER 12, 1997\n</tt>\n\nIf the Medical Grand Round series is somewhat like a medical journal,\npresenting a combination of the newest studies in diagnosis and\ntreatment, summaries of the "state of the art" and so on, then this\noffering today will be a little different. For one, there won't be any\nslides. Today this will be more analogous to those other columns in The\nAnnals of Internal Medicine or JAMA that go by the name of "On Being a\nDoctor" and "A Piece of My Mind" . These columns tend to bring a\ndifferent point of view into the journal which stimulates thought and\nreflection on one's own experience as a physician. When I was a\nresident, I must confess, I never read these columns for I was only\ninterested just in the "facts", the hard stuff. Lately, though, I\noften find them compelling.\n\nBefore I get into the main ideas of this talk, I would like to bring\nyour attention to the handouts which are, in part from the JAMA "A\nPiece of My Mind" column. These are copies of a series of articles by\nDr. Roger Bone. Dr. Bone, as many of you know, was one of the preeminent\nscientist-physician-teachers of our time, a pulmonologist, intensivist,\na researcher in ICU medicine, sepsis, editing and writing prolificly. My\nown book shelves are literally lined with the Mosby Yearbook of Medicine\nseries, co-edited by him. Many of us have heard him give Grand Rounds\nhere. In June of 1995, he was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, which\nwas diagnosed as metastatic in October of 1995. He died on June 8, 1997,\nthis year, at the age of 56. During this time he wrote a number of\narticles which were reflections on the practice of medicine and the end\nof life including a booklet on end of life issues for the American\nKidney Society. These articles are enriched from his point of view of\nbeing a patient and inspired by the nearness of his own death. In a way,\nthey are very analogous to the much more well known recent illness and\ndeath in Chicago of Cardinal Bernadin, for these are reflections of a\npeople coming to grips with death and growing from it. In one of the\nJAMA pieces, Dr. Bone writes:\n\n"I write this to record my last months of life. I write it for myself,\nfor my family, and , I hope, for those many people in the future who\nmight find comfort in it as they also face death, Three years ago, this\ncould not have been written---at least not the way it is now. The reason\nis simple: Three years ago, I was not dying. But, even more than that, I\nhad no idea what dying is all about, although I thought I had a fair\nunderstanding of death. I saw death more times than I can count. I\nalways thought that death caused the collapse of the dying person inward\nupon himself. The dying person appeared to be little more than a\nshrunken shell lying in a hospital bed. Physical collapse meant that\nthere was a collapse of the mental and spiritual being as well.\n\nI know now I could not have been more wrong.\n\nDeath has opened my eyes to life - literally."\n\nI think you will find these articles very moving and they illustrate and\nexpress, more eloquently than I, some of the ideas that I want to\ndiscuss today, many of these ideas also informed by my own experience of\nbeing a patient.\n\nToday then, I would like to talk about some spiritual aspects of life\nthreatening illness and the practice of medicine. Take this as a "work\nin progress" without definite conclusions.\n\nEvery life threatening illness has both danger and opportunity within\nit. We know very well of the danger and are familiar with the fear\nassociated with that danger. Most of our professional lives has to do\nwith dealing with that danger, trying to properly diagnose, treat and\nmanage it. Sometimes, though, with some patients, the "opportunity"\npart comes up. When it does, it is always striking, inspiring and gives\ntrue meaning to the clichs about clouds having silver linings, gold\nhidden in dark places.\n\nAs you may know, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of two\npictographs - one for danger and one for opportunity. It is this latter\npart of the crisis of life threatening illness about which I want to\nspeak: the opportunity for spiritual growth or spiritual unfolding. The\nreal dangers and real fears of illness can defeat our souls or they can\nbe a catalyst to the inner chemistry of the unfolding of the soul. And\nthe soul, even in illness and death, can flourish and triumph.. In fact,\nI would propose that in the openness that life threatening illness can\nbring, we may be more open than at most other times in our life to\nreceiving a spiritual teaching.\n\nHowever, the subject of this talk is particularly challenging to me\nbecause, like so many professionals, I have internalized my own kind of\n"separation between church and state" , mostly keeping professional\nlife and spiritual life separate. It is as if there has been within me\nand within my practice of medicine a boundary that is analogous to the\nkind of boundary we have had in western civilization for the past few\nhundred years between science and religion.\n\nIn a recent issue of Natural History Magazine, the evolutionary\nbiologist and paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould has an article in which\nhe argues that science and religion have eliminated much conflict by\nmutual recognition that each has teaching authority or professional\nexpertise over non-overlapping domains: the empirical constitution of\nthe universe is the professional expertise of science while the search\nfor proper ethical values and the search for spiritual meaning is the\ndomain of religion.\n\nThe net of science covers the empirical universe: what it is made of\n(fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion\nextends over questions of moral meaning and value and these two\n\\[domains\\] do not overlap...\n\nTo put it more simply, the turf has been divided. The scientists have\nthe physical world, the material world and randomness as a basic (and\nuseful) assumption. Questions of meaning and purpose are not considered\nto be scientific. In science, teleological questions, questions with a\n"Why" before them, are generally considered inferior questions.\n//00000112/#\\_ftn2&gt;\\[2\\] Religions have the turf of meaning and\nvalues. So if you want to know 'why', don't go to a scientist, go to\na clergyman.\n\nHowever, Gould goes on to say:\n\n...these two \\[domains\\] bump right up against each another,\ninterdigitating in wondrously complex ways along their joint border.\nMany of our deepest questions call upon aspects of both for different\nparts of a full answer - and the sorting of legitimate domains can\nbecome quite complex and difficult. Medical training and medical\npractice is mostly applied science. Whether\nit is physical, biological science or so called "behavioral science",\nthere is little training or even "official" recognition that human\nbeings are not only physical and psychological beings, but even more so,\nspiritual beings. That would be a tough assertion to make on medical\nrounds: it is so vague and unverifiable, unquantifiable and we doctors\nare nothing if not eminently concrete and practical. Remember, most of\nthe advances in medicine in this century come from the realm of science,\nand that has been what has been emphasized in our training. Think about\nmodern antibiotic, vaccine, not to mention surgeries, organ transplants,\nkidney dialysis and so on, treatments, which we consider routine, that\nwould have been considered miraculous in any other era in human history.\n\n When we become ill, or suffer any kind of tragedy or sorrow, though, we\noften begin to ask in earnest, "why". Science is very good at\nanswering "how" questions: how infection with this bacteria or virus\nled to these symptoms or how high blood pressure and high cholesterol\nlevels led to this coronary plaque and to this MI. If a person asks\n"why" to his physician, to one of us, and you listen very carefully to\nthe physician's answer, you will hear disguised "how" answers most of\nthe time. For the "why" answers you need to go to a clergyman, the\nchaplain, perhaps, or to a guru. But if they are honest with their\nexplanations, they too will leave some open space, a space that\ncorrelates with the degree of inscrutability they attribute to God, the\ndegree to which they have been affected by modernism, the degree to\nwhich they are comfortable "not knowing." For "why" questions are\nquestions of meaning and science has little to offer in this regard.\nHowever, with traditional religious "answers" regarding meaning open\nto question today, we most often need to discover meaning somewhere\nwithin us. Certainly others can help us and the wisdom carried by\nreligions is available to us, but skepticism is also one of the\ncornerstones of the scientific mind and skepticism is part of the legacy\nof our age. So not only doesn't science give us the "why" answers, it\ntends to undermine the traditional "why" explanations of religion.\n\n But we humans need to know why we suffer. It was Nietzche who said,\n"He\nwho has a why to live for can suffer any how." And, therefore, much of\nthe spiritual work associated with illness is in this dimension\ndelineated by "why". It is in the realm of meaning and this realm of\nmeaning is in an orthogonal dimension to the realm described by science.\n\n So the subject of this talk does make me edgy.. But, it is at this\n"orthogonal" border where these two domains "bump right against each\nother" that I want to take us..\n\n Do imagine for a moment that we are at this borderline, this "no\nman's\nland" between science and religion, the material and the spiritual, the\nsecular and the sacred for life threatening illness very quickly brings\nus into this borderland.\n\n In one of the articles you have, Dr Bone writes four "observations",\nwhich, I would propose, come from his experience in this borderland:\n\n 1\\. Good health is often taken for granted; however, it is the most\nprecious commodity one possesses.\n\n 2\\. One's spouse, children, family, and friends are the essential\ningredients that allow one to endure an experience such a as a serious\nunexpected illness.\n\n 3\\. When faced with death, one recognizes the importance of God, and\none's relationship to God.\n\n 4\\. The things that one does throughout one's life that seem so urgent\nare, most of the time, not so important.\n\n For myself, this borderland became intensely real one summer afternoon\nwhen I found my way into the Emergency Room here at Evanston Hospital\nwith chest pains, flat on my back and very rapidly, went from doctor to\npatient, and, almost, corpse in the course of about thirty minutes. All\nof a sudden, the doctor role dropped away and something much more\nessential was revealed. Something we all know, but can easily forget in\nour professional lives. It was that before we are doctors and patients,\nwe are all people. We are all souls.\n\n Therefore, one of the major themes that I want to raise for us to think\nabout this morning, is that of boundaries and boundary crossing. It is\nnot the boundaries between countries or states that I am addressing, but\nthe boundaries we often draw between professional life and spiritual\nlife, doctor and patient, illness and health, mind and body, psyche and\nspirit, even life and death. I, for one, have lived within fairly strict\nboundaries, trying to keep things neat and tidy. It doesn't always\nwork. I doubt that it works very well for you either. I am not trying to\nsay that boundaries don't serve a useful purpose: they do. If you are a\nphysician, for example, and trying to maintain a reasonable family life,\nyou have to draw boundaries somewhere. There are important boundaries\none often needs to draw in caring or not caring for family members. So,\nthis is not a challenge to all boundaries. But, to experience\nlife-threatening illness, either as a patient, a family member, close\nfriend or a professional is potentially to find ourselves crossing\nboundaries. It is to find ourselves crossing some boundaries we may have\nthought impermeable and others which we didn't even know were there.\n\n For better or worse, we are living at a time when boundaries in all\nareas of life are seeming to be redrawn. This is certainly true in\nmedicine, psychology and religion. For the most part, it can be an\nunsettling experience. And we resist. However, just as the boundaries\nbetween nations that we "see" on a map disappear when we look at the\nreal thing, like the earth from space, many of the boundaries that we\nwill be speaking of disappear when we look with a larger perspective.\nAnd, encountering a life-threatening illness can give that larger\nperspective.\n\n In psychological terms, the close encounter with death makes us\nvulnerable and potentially more open than we may be at any other time.\nFamiliar identity is challenged. One's self-image is no longer fixed.\nThe ground upon which we stand moves like an earthquake and we can feel\nto be in a free fall. We no longer can take things for granted, but out\nof that chaos can come a new perspective. For the "taken for granted"\nis also often another way of being unconscious, another way of living in\nignorance of the every day miracle we call "life".\n\n A patient dying of AIDS said:\n\n "I didn't want this, and I hated this, and I was terrified of this.\nBut it turns out that this illness has been my greatest gift. Now every\nmoment is precious to me. All the people in my life are so precious to\nme. My whole life means so much more."\n\n In Greek mythology, Hermes, the Messenger of God, is the traditional\ngod\nof boundaries and traffic over them. He is the guide of souls through\nthis transitional space, for we never travel alone. Humans have always\nhad guides through the ages, though we may understand them differently\nin different eras. Murray Stein, a Jungian analyst in Chicago, in a\nsomewhat different context, says that Hermes "represents a type of\nconsciousness that exists essentially within transitional time and\nspace" ... and he refers to this condition as "liminality".\nLiminality refers to the Latin limen, meaning doorway or threshold. And\nit is the image of the door, along with that of boundaries, that I want\nus to imagine. In the experience of life threatening illness, we cross\nthresholds, enter doorways. We go from the familiar to the unfamiliar,\nfrom the known to the unknown. Not just patients, but doctors and\nnurses, too. Sometimes, it is quite literally a different place, like a\nhospital, but more so it is a different psychological space. And Hermes\naccompanies us though I do not mean this literally, but symbolically. We\nhave deep, though often unconscious programming that is part of our\nendowment as humans. Call it the "collective unconscious," as Jung\ncalled it, or "archetypal consciousness" as some of the transpersonal\npsychologists would call, or "Divine Aid," as religions have called\nit, but we are not alone. For some this is concretized in the image of\nJesus or Elohim or that of the Divine Mother. For others, it may Great\nSpirit or the Prophet. We are not alone. It has something to do with\nfaith.\n\n Another dying patient said:\n\n "When you've come to the edge of all the Light you know, and you are\nabout to step off into the Darkness of the Unknown, Faith is knowing one\nof two things will happen---there will be something solid to stand on or\nyou will be taught how to fly."\n\n So illness brings us into a world of doors and boundaries and we are\naccompanied by some form of the "Messenger of God", in our travels.\n\n Once again, I need to back off a little in this domain.\n\n I suppose that it is pretty weird for me as an internist to be talking\nabout illness in this way during Medical Grand Rounds. For our whole\ntraining in medicine is mostly focused on disease processes, diagnosis,\nand treatment, pathophysiology. The physician-patient encounter is\ntaught as one in which you get the "history", whose purpose is to\nferret out from the symptoms a pattern which is recognizable as a\ndisease, and then do the "physical examination" and order laboratory\ntests. It is applied science. And, of course, we love it. But, many a\npatient finds it an unsatisfactory, incomplete experience, for there is\na lot more going on in the patient role than just a conglomeration of\nsymptoms. We all know that, but how do we address it, practically\nspeaking? To relate only through scientific training seems to me to be\nlimited. For in the face of life-threatening illness, there is a great\nhunger for spiritual attention. It is often a time when we are very\nopen, but it is often unrecognized and unaddressed. We can just look at\nthe list of best sellers by physicians Deepok Chopra, Bernie Siegel,\nAndrew Weil, Larry Dossey and Scott Peck, just to name a few, over the\npast few years to see some measure of that huge hunger. We can see it in\nthe rise of alternate medicine, where people spend billions of dollars,\nmost of it "out of pocket", not covered by medical insurance.\n\n So I think that though it may be weird to be speaking this way as an\ninternist, when I cross any other boundary and see myself as a patient,\nor as just a human being, it is not. Indeed, this may be a cutting edge\nof medicine in the future, a counter movement to the industrialization\nprocess now underway called "managed care." For managed care has\nhelped us cut expenses but it does so by bringing in the same kinds of\nthinking that have been successful in other businesses and slowly, but\nsurely it moves medicine more and more into the world of mass production\nand standardization. This is an impersonal world, and while it may have\ncertain advantages, even in medicine, it is not likely to address\nspiritual needs. So, it brings with it a counter movement and this\ncounter movement has spirituality at its core.\n\n In doing a medline search for this talk, I came across a fascinating\nPresidential Valedictory Lecture given to the British Royal College of\nPsychiatrists in 1993 by Andrew Sims. Titled "'Psyche' - Spirit as\nwell as Mind?", he admonishes psychiatry for ignoring the spiritual\nexperience of patients and goes on to say:\n\n "The great taboo at the start of this century was sex, but it is now\nthe last resort of the burnt out comedian. The unspeakable in the middle\nof the century was death, and now teaching about bereavement has even\ncome back into undergraduate medical education. What is unmentionable at\nthe end of the century is the personal experience of religious faith....\nYet spiritual concepts are, for many thoughout the world, a perfectly\nordinary part of everyday existence."\n\n So it is in the spirit of breaking this taboo, in the spirit of\ncrossing\nboundaries, and in the spirit of sharing that I want to tell you a story\nof a day when I crossed the line from doctor to patient. And it\ncertainly seems appropriate to share this experience here.\n\n The experience, which I would like to share, is that of a heart attack\nand cardiac arrest which was in August of 1995. It is an event, a date,\nthat has a "before and after" quality to it, the way all\nlife-threatening experiences have. A friend who has had stage 3 breast\ncancer and is surviving after the harrowing treatment that has included\na bone marrow transplant, dates her "before and after" to the\ntelephone call in which the surgeon told her biopsy results and\nprognosis. Sometimes it is a well-defined moment like that: an abnormal\nmammogram, a chest x - ray, blood in the stools, results of a blood test\nor an MRI scan. But it could be a pain, the swerve of the automobile, or\nthe smell of smoke. In Dr. Bones's JAMA piece, "The Taste of Lemonade\non a Summer Afternoon", he starts out by describing his first symptom,\nthe passing of blood in his urine on Christmas Day. Think about how many\nof these "before and after" events we as physicians participate in?\nThink how patients often describe them in a story-like way that can seem\nto have little relevance to us, as we abstract out the "facts" that we\nseek in the "history of present illness". How routine they can become\nto us, how easily ignored. How conscious are we of the meaning, the\nsignificance to the patient of what we often so casually may say?\n\n At other times the "before and after" is not so clearly related to an\nevent but an inner realization. And though that realization is complex,\nit partly a realization that nothing is ever going to be the same again.\nIt is also the realization: I am going to die. It may pass. The disease\nis cured, we may forget, deny, repress, whatever words seem appropriate.\nBut, we are not the same anymore. From a spiritual point of view, we\nhave been initiated into finiteness---into the human condition. Before,\nwe knew we were going to die, but death was more of a concept than a\nreality. Now we know. There is a Zen saying that "In the face of real\nexperience, concepts are like snowflakes falling on an open fire."\n\n All of this is true not only for the person who is ill, but also for\nall\nof those close to him or her. The effects of a life-threatening illness\nspread out like waves on water when a stone is thrown in. The closer we\nare to someone, the more profoundly we are touched by it and everything\nsaid just now applies. The whole family goes through these experiences:\nadults, children, even pets. Co-workers, acquaintances, patients,\nclients. The opportunity for the teachings of life-threatening illness\nto be received, extend to all of us. We don't necessarily need to\nexperience everything first hand to learn from it. And we who work here\nin this hospital are also affected, much more than we may even be aware.\n\n As I tell this story, I would like to try and tell it in a way that you\nactually are there. For, though it is my story, it is actually a story\nthat occurs day in and day out, in this form or a somewhat different\none. Therefore, it is a universal story as well. I am going to try and\nsay it in second person, using "you" instead of "I", though I might\nswitch back and forth a little. But, the overall intent is for you to\ntry and imagine yourself in this.\n\n August 20 was a hot Sunday in Chicago. You were off that weekend,\nthough\nthere were some telephone calls from the emergency room and from\npatients in the morning. One was from a patient who was in Wisconsin, a\nfew hours away, and who was having chest pains. She had been evaluated\nby your associate in the previous week and he didn't think it was\nanything serious but she was having them again and was frightened. So,\nafter some discussion, you said that it was safe for her to drive back\nto Evanston and come to the emergency room. You spoke with the ER about\nher and another patient, who you had never seen but was the mother of\none of your patients, and you agreed to care for her if she needed\nadmission for what turned out to be a fractured pelvis. You were\nsomewhat annoyed that all this activity had taken place on a rare day\nwhen you were "off" but it is hard for you to answer a telephone and\nsay "no" or "I'm not here."\n\n I am in a three-person practice of internal medicine and the summers\ntend to be very busy, for the simple fact that it seems as if one of us\nis on vacation all the time so that you are covering each other's\npractice when you are not yourself on vacation. The preceding week was\nextremely stressful because of a tragic death of a friend' s son in\nCincinnatti. He was 28 years old and died in the severe heat of an\nasthma attack. We had driven to Cincinnatti for the funeral and back in\ntwo days. It was very sad, emotional and physically taxing. In\nretrospect, you remember stopping at McDonald's on the way there and\nback and drinking thick chocolate shakes and eating French fries. In\nCincinnatti, you had a uncharacteristic breakfast of fried eggs, hash\nbrowns and bacon or sausage. These are the kind of details you remember\nlater, when you read more recent studies on coronary artery plaque\ninstability.\n\n Well, on this hot Sunday afternoon, you went to Lake Michigan, which is\na few blocks from your home and read the Sunday Tribune and stood in the\ncool water. After about an hour you went into the Northwestern athletic\ncenter to work out, and though you felt rather washed out, you did a\nwork out, of sorts, on a life cycle, a rowing machine, and using some\nweights. In the shower, though, you began to feel very weak and shaky\nand started sweating profusely. You began to feel pain in both your\nforearms. At this point, you got slowly dressed and walked upstairs to a\nvending machine to get a cranberry drink, thinking that you were\nexperiencing a hypoglycemic reaction, remembering you had not had lunch.\nYour thoughts were very slow.\n\n You bought the drink, sat down to drink it and the can felt extremely\nheavy. You could barely lift it. A sip didn't do any good. You started\nto think that something serious was going on, and even that you should\ncall for help and get to the hospital. But, you were embarrassed by the\nthought of causing a big stir here, and also you couldn't really\nbelieve that anything that serious could be going on. You slowly walked\nout the building into the heat and you needed to sit down in front of\nit, when you saw one of the medical residents from the hospital coming\nin to exercise. You thought to call out to her to help but before you\ncould say anything, she was gone into the building. It was steaming hot\noutside and your brain just said, "Get home." You walked slowly to the\ncar and drove home. All the while, pains were coming up from your arms\ninto your chest. You passed Evanston Hospital, going down Central\nStreet, thinking that you should turn in there, but when you passed it,\nyou couldn't even imagine how to turn around and go inside. So you\ncontinued another few blocks to home, where you pulled in the driveway,\nleft your gym bag in the car, walked in, lay down on the bed, and told\nyour older son to call 911, that you were having chest pain.\n\n The paramedics were there in a few moments and were giving you\nnitroglycerin and so on. They were calling in to the ER and talking\nabout elevated ST segments. You can still remember some of your thoughts\nas you lie there, getting obvious relief from the nitroglycerin tablets\nunder your tongue. But you were thinking that their field equipment\nwasn't that accurate and that they were overreading and making it more\ndramatic than it was.\n\n Denial? Did I hear anyone out there think denial? Who me(?),---who knew\nevery step of the way what was going on, but couldn't really accept it?\nAt that time I just could not cross the boundary between health and\nillness, being "normal" and mortally ill. Part of me just couldn't do\nit. Granted, it lasted only 15 to 20 minutes, but denial is denial. How\ndo we cope with such bad news? It is hard sometimes to see that\neverything is changed, and to adapt. How many older patients have we\ncared for who needed hospitalization but who, so irrationally, didn't\nwant an ambulance to take them from their home? A few months ago, I was\ncalled to care for a patient in the ICU who was in a coma on a\nrespirator, had gained 80 pounds of fluid in a few weeks in the effort\nto keep her blood pressure up, had bowel necrosis and raging infections,\nwhose abdominal incision had shown not the slightest granulation one\nweek post op, but whose daughter was still wondering about an infusion\nof massive doses of vitamin C the day before she finally accepted that\nher mother was going to die. My real job in this case was not to try and\nget this patient better---much more competent physicians and nurses than\nI had been working on that---but to work with her daughter's denial. I\ncould now understand a little better her denial, that this (her\nmother's death) truly was unthinkable.\n\n But when we let in the "unthinkable" is that not also an expansion of\nconsciousness? Is that not what spiritual unfolding is all about? Is\nthis not "growth" of the soul? Do we not have to expand our sense of\nacceptance, expand the heart, in order to grow from suffering, in\ngeneral? (The spiritual heart. I am not talking about ventricular\ndilatation!)\n\n You remember so vividly your youngest son, 11 years old, coming in the\nroom---you know, the one who you are having difficult times with. And he\nsays, "I love you, Dad". Then you know you must look pretty bad. As\nyou were wheeled outside to the ambulance, which seemed so RED in the\nsun, and driven to the ER, another boundary was crossed. You had been in\nthis ER literally thousands of times over the past 13 years, but never\nhad you seen it from this angle, flat on your back. You were now a\npatient and it is not so easy for a doctor, so used to being in control,\nto be flat on his back, a patient. You had a strange feeling,\nremembering being a baby, wheeled in a carriage. Perhaps, that was the\nlast time you were wheeled in somewhere, feeling this helpless.\n\n The first person you remember seeing in the ER was your patient from\nWisconsin, who you sent there hours earlier with chest pain. You had\nforgotten about her. She looked at you in total amazement and in a few\nmoments, her husband peeked into your stall to verify that indeed, it\nwas you. You were no longer the doctor "in control".\n\n In the ER, you believed the doctors when they said you indeed did have\nST elevations and were having an anterior myocardial infarction. The\nnitroglycerin did help and you loved them, looking forward to the next\none. You are asked to rate the pain. This is one of those things that\nhelps to understand how things are going. You are thinking, this is\npretty bad, but my kidney stone was worse, so you gave it an "8". You\nare now getting intravenous lopressor, aspirin and the heparin was\ngetting started. One of the medical residents, who you knew well from\nsupervising him for two years in clinic, and who is a very funny guy,\ntells you that he needs to do a rectal exam since they are starting\nheparin. You remind him to be sure and check the prostate at the same\ntime. You shift into humor mode. Dave, the ER doc keeps asking you to\nrate the pain, and you think it got as low as a "4". Time, though,\ntime was getting very compressed in the intensity of everything.\n\n In a few moments, you felt a little light-headed, but more than that,\nyou heard a sound that sounded like cicadas. It was that high-pitched\nsound they make in the summer. You asked Dave what that sound was, and\nhe said, with a voice tinged in anxiety and comfort, not to worry, for\nit was the sound people hear when they run lidocaine in quickly. Oh, you\nthought, lidocaine - you must be having an arrhythmia.\n\n And that was your last earthly thought. Almost.\n\n For in the next moment, you were transported to a different world, a\ndifferent zone. It is difficult to describe, but it was both dark, black\nactually, but luminous. You know it can't be both but it was. There\nwere three lights or figures that were like stars but were more figures\nthan stars. It was extraordinarily quiet and peaceful. It was like every\nmuscle relaxed and every care was removed. There was a sense of\nmovement, going toward the figures, being carried in that direction. It\nis not easy to describe this. There was no sense of time. It was like\nwaking up out of a sleep, and, like going to sleep when you take a nap\nin the daytime. It was very vivid.\n\n And then, Dave, who is about 6 feet 4 inches and 220 pounds, is about\nsix inches from your face, tears in his eyes, very emotional. He seems\nto be very excited, yelling, "Bob, we got you back. You were in\nV-fib!"\n\n You remember looking at him, feeling very strange, thinking, is he all\nright? Then he said, "Did you see the white light?" Still feeling very\ncalm and ironic, you said, "No, but I was going up the black tunnel."\n\n This all seemed slightly humorous at the time, even if it was a\ngallows-type humor. But, isn't that how we cope? I sure do. How many\nFriday afternoons have you signed out to one of your partners, your\nsides aching from laughing so hard at the sign out---this laughter a\nhealthy substitute for the tears you would shed during the week if you\nweren't so emotionally controlled.\n\n You lay there on the ER bed and it strikes you what has just happened,\nhow close you just were to being gone forever and that it could happen\nany time again. The beach, the sunny afternoon, your home, your\nfamily---all seem so distant, so far away. A multitude of feelings from\nall the various reaches of your being come in. Conscious, unconscious,\nautonomic, primordial. Foremost was this feeling of wanting to live,\nfeeling that it was not your time yet. You felt "in the middle of\nthings", not ending. You felt lonely. Would you ever see your wife and\nchildren and friends again? You began to decide what prayer to say, for\nafter 22 years of daily spiritual practice, there were a lot of\npossibilities. Then, out of the depths from some unconscious place came,\nsomething you had never said before. It was simply: "If it be Thy Will,\nIf it be Thy Will." And with it came a sense not just of surrender, but\nof sacred submission. A feeling that you had never quite had before---at\nleast like that. It was a total stripping away of the feeling of having\nany power or anything; but with it, came surrender and a feeling of\npeace. And this came up from some unknown depths, for on the surface was\na big component of fear. Over and over again, silently, you said, "If\nit be Thy Will." The difference between life and death at this point\nfelt as slim as flicking a switch on and off. It was on now, but how\nlong, and who held the switch was beyond me.\n\n From there came the cardiologists and your partners and your spouse and\nwe went into the cardiac cath lab which you saw from such a different\nangle. An angiogram diagnosed a totally occluded left anterior\ndescending artery. It was amazingly quickly and efficiently done and an\nangioplasty guide wire was passed and the first balloon inflated. The\npain came back.\n\n Everyone thought this was great since it indicated viable myocardium.\nYou asked how long one needed to keep the balloon inflated and learned\nan update of one of those basic life lessons: "Well, we've learned\nthat the longer we can keep it inflated, the better the results."\n"Okay," you thought, "but just give me an idea of how long you're\nthinking." "About 20 minutes." It helps to know how long, but with so\nmuch at stake, they could have said three hours and you would have said\nfine. You felt total confidence in whatever they said. When the\ninflations were over and the pain stopped, an intra-aortic balloon pump\nwas left in the aorta for the next two days. It was noticeable only if\nyou paid attention to a kind of blip in the chest---a stronger heart\nbeat.\n\n The CCU nurses were like angels. Not ethereal angels, but kind of\nlivesaving types. You began to feel things were going to work out. The\nangioplasty was successful in opening up the artery and even though\nthere is another 90% lesion in a smaller obtuse marginal vessel, there\nwas a general feeling of relief and of having passed through the worst\nas night came.\n\n Later, after a few days, when things were settled, you asked for a book\nto be brought to the hospital which was Meister Eckhart's sermons. You\nneeded to read the one he had written called "Blessed are the Poor",\nwhich is an exegesis on "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is\nthe Kingdom of Heaven." It said it all. It was in "having nothing,\nknowing nothing, wanting nothing and being nothing" that we recognize\nthe extent to which we live by God's grace. And while this could have\nbeen just good luck, or just good medical care, it had a different\nfeeling to it as well---another dimension, orthogonal to the others, and\nit was that of being blessed by God's grace. Which, of course, despite\nour chronic complaining of how bad things are, is there, unrecognized,\nall the time.\n\n Which brings us to the original title of this talk when it was given in\nSt. Louis: "Dying to Live". I thought it was kind of a catchy title\nbecause it has so many possible meanings. First, is in the sense when we\nsay in a kind of slang exaggeration, like on a hot day, "I am dying for\nan ice cream." , meaning "I really want ice cream" or "I really want\nto live". And that is applicable here: "I was dying to live" - "We\nare all dying to live."\n\n But, dying to live also points to something else. It points to one of\nthe basic universal, archetypal themes, and that is the theme of\nresurrection: out of death, comes new life. It is the ultimate religious\ntheme, but it is a medical theme as well. Isn't that what surgery and\ngeneral anesthesia is all about? In some sense we "die", become\nunconscious, and, if all goes well, we are resurrected with a diseased\npart gone or a new hip.\n\n But resurrection only comes after something dies. It comes after we\nhave\nlet go of something. After we have let go, first, of the way we thought\nthings were supposed to be. We all have expectations, a kind of model in\nour minds of how life should go. My own experience is that much of this\nis unconscious but we become aware of it when things stop going our way,\nwhen the expectations are not met. And , we need to let go. Letting go\nof what we want, what we thought was going to be, and, instead,\naccepting what is.\n\n So much easier to say than to do, and it is not a one-time thing, but a\nprocess. It is something that all health professionals help facilitate\nall the time, but it is not always a conscious process.\n\n If we are, as many religious people would say, "spiritual beings on a\nhuman path," having this experience of being human in order to learn\nwhat we need, then what we have been given, is what we need. I know this\nis a very hard thing to say, and I would never say it like this to\nsomeone else. But, I do try to apply it to myself and when I have seen\nothers understand their suffering in this way, true resurrections\noccur---not always the physical resurrection that one would have really\nwanted, the cure, the remission, the restoration of function---but other\nthings. We learn to let go of past grudges, forgive others, forgive\nourselves, open ourselves, break out of the self - centeredness that\nhas, unknowingly, trapped us and kept us disconnected in a deep sense.\nOne of my favorite songs, by Leonard Cohen, has the chorus:\n\n Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering. There\nis a crack, a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\nThat's how the light gets in.\n\n To learn to love better, we need to let go of so much. The spiritual\nword for that is renouncement. Renouncement not as self-denial, but as a\nway of relating better; letting go of unnecessary baggage. Symbolically,\nrenouncement is the opening of our grasping hand. \\[DEMONSTRATE\\]\nReconciled to being finite, to having a limited lifespan, we connect\never stronger with the great flow that we are a part of. Call it the\nuniverse or God or history or nature. It is everywhere.\n\n I want to read a section from journal which was written at\nThanksgiving,\n1995. It elaborates a little more on this theme of renouncement, a theme\nthat is central to the spiritual path I have followed over the past 25\nyears.\n\n "This morning, riding out to Glenbrook Hospital, I did a calculation.\nIt is 95 days since my heart attack and cardiac arrest. I see this as a\n"second life", one I almost did not have. This part of my life feels\nlike a gift. It also gives life a "borrowed" quality. We are all\nliving on "borrowed time", though it is rare to think of it that way.\nMostly we feel ownership of our time, of our lives. We own them. This is\ncertainly better than to feel we are living as if someone else owned\nthem. Too many people - perhaps most - have that experience. But,\nneither do we really own our lives either: we have been created. The\nfirst part of my life was a gift, too, but I never really saw it quite\nthat way.\n\n The spirit of renouncement is to realize one never truly owns anything.\nWe are responsible for things, for our actions, thoughts and so on. We\nshould be stewards, responsible caretakers, for the world's wealth. But\npossession is always temporary and this temporariness is easily mistaken\nfor permanence. Can I give thanks with my life? In some very simple,\ndeeper way, I understand (if that is even the right word) renouncement\nmore clearly. We are born and die naked. In between, what matters are\nour connections, relationships with the Whole. The Whole includes all\nthe parts, what theologians call the Immanent, what we might call\n"daily life". The Whole is not something separate from the parts."\n\n On the one year anniversary of the heart attack, I worked out at\nNorthwestern, the scene of it all beginning that day. After my run, for\nrunning has become my current discipline (surprise!), I showered in the\nsame shower stall as I when I first experienced the sweating, the\nweakness and the arm and chest pains. Who should walk in but Tim, the\ncardiologist who did the angiogram and angioplasty that day. I briefly\nsaid hello and reminded him of the anniversary, which he acknowledged.\nThen, as I looked up at the clock, I saw it was 6 P.M., the exact time\nof that angioplasty, for I remember that the balloon was inflated for\ntwenty minutes, beginning at 6 P.M. and that during this time all of the\npain came back. I watched the clock from the cath table very carefully.\nThe coincidence of this meeting in the shower, one year to the minute\nseemed and seems more than just a random coincidence. For me, it had the\npower of somehow proving the very existence of God. But, as a doctor, a\nscientist, how can you say such things, except in an ironic voice. Even\nnow. It is as if that boundary between science and the spirit once again\nshows itself.\n\n Earlier this year, the Chicago Tribune ran a piece by Saul Bellow, the\nNobel prize winning author. In 1993 he suffered a life threatening\nillness which was a poisoning of his central nervous system with toxin\nthat he contracted from bad fish in the Caribbean. He spent a month in\nthe intensive care unit in Boston, with a very long recovery period. He\nshared his reflections at a medical conference in Chicago. Amongst other\nthings, he said:\n\n "In preparing my talk, I rejected at once the temptation to tell a\nconvention of doctors how to conduct themselves with their patients. A\nteam of doctors at Boston University hospital saved my life two years\nago. Some of them seem to have taken my survival seriously, but I would\nsooner have them effective than compassionate. That is, if I were to\nhave a choice...\n\n No one can tell doctors what to do. ... We can't possibly tell human\nbeings, adults, to be caring, compassionate, sensitive; to interact, to\nenter into intimacies from therapeutic motives, et cetera.\n\n No other person can value your life as you do. Nor should you demand or\neven expect such a valuation from anybody else...."\n\n He describes in some detail how his senior neurologist was deeply\ninvolved with his recovery. The part that came after survival was no\nlonger the issue. He says:\n\n "The doctor's outlook---or if you prefer, his ideology---is humane,\nbut his training is in science, and science does not see nature as\nhaving a soul. But the neurologist, Dr. X, did have a soul. He was\ncapable of compassion, although in nature there is no compassion, so he\ncame early in the morning and late at night and on the weekends."\n\n And as I work as a physician, I hear those words very clearly.\nCompassion is important, but only if it accompanies being effective. We\nstill need to make the diagnosis, give the best treatment and often,\nassemble the best team of specialists and sub-specialists to help our\npatient. And there are many ways to go about it.\n\n And so as we end, I think we are back to acknowledging boundaries, even\nas we acknowledge that we pass through them. At this point in time, I\naccept ambivalence and acknowledge that there are no easy answers, at\nleast for me. For me, death remains the ultimate mystery or potentially\nthe doorway to the ultimate mystery. But I do know the value and the\ntruth of renouncement and the joy and necessity of living life to its\nfullest.\n\n I want to leave with the following poem which I wrote during the few\nweeks off after this experience. It poses a challenge that I still feel,\ntrying to live better in this "second chance" of a life.\n\n     \n    \n    \n    \n    The Loom\n    \n    \n    Time passes and everything changes,\n    But nothing changes very much.\n    Four Ancient Women are weaving the Life-times,\n    Here.\n    The Loom is as big as a galaxy,\n    The threads are invisible to us, but have\n    Something to do\n    With Cause and Effect.\n    Threads, connecting threads between lives\n    And deaths,\n    Connections, relationships, synchronicities,\n    But mostly,\n    Unseen.\n    We're too busy to notice, too much to do.\n    Life is work or else,  sleep or else unconsciousness.\n    Is there another way?\n    Can one get a glimmer of the threads now and again and live\n    In the Weave?\n{: .pretty}\n\n Thank you.\n\n <tt> Dr. Robert Magrisso is an internist in practice in Winnetka,\nIllinois, an Associate Medical Director for the Palliative Care Center\nof the North Shore, and on the staffs of Evanston Northwestern\nHealthcare and Northwestern University Medical School. </tt>\n\n	2011-08-06 03:42:29.510416	2005-08-14 10:25:15	<p><tt> The following is a transcript of a lecture presented at MEDICAL\nGRAND ROUNDS, EVANSTON (IL) NORTHWESTERN HEALTHCARE, DECEMBER 12, 1997\n</tt></p>\n\n<p>If the Medical Grand Round series is somewhat like a medical journal,\npresenting a combination of the newest studies in diagnosis and\ntreatment, summaries of the &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; and so on, then this\noffering today will be a little different. For one, there won&#39;t be any\nslides. Today this will be more analogous to those other columns in The\nAnnals of Internal Medicine or JAMA that go by the name of &ldquo;On Being a\nDoctor&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Piece of My Mind&rdquo; . These columns tend to bring a\ndifferent point of view into the journal which stimulates thought and\nreflection on one&#39;s own experience as a physician. When I was a\nresident, I must confess, I never read these columns for I was only\ninterested just in the &ldquo;facts&rdquo;, the hard stuff. Lately, though, I\noften find them compelling.</p>\n\n<p>Before I get into the main ideas of this talk, I would like to bring\nyour attention to the handouts which are, in part from the JAMA &ldquo;A\nPiece of My Mind&rdquo; column. These are copies of a series of articles by\nDr. Roger Bone. Dr. Bone, as many of you know, was one of the preeminent\nscientist-physician-teachers of our time, a pulmonologist, intensivist,\na researcher in ICU medicine, sepsis, editing and writing prolificly. My\nown book shelves are literally lined with the Mosby Yearbook of Medicine\nseries, co-edited by him. Many of us have heard him give Grand Rounds\nhere. In June of 1995, he was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, which\nwas diagnosed as metastatic in October of 1995. He died on June 8, 1997,\nthis year, at the age of 56. During this time he wrote a number of\narticles which were reflections on the practice of medicine and the end\nof life including a booklet on end of life issues for the American\nKidney Society. These articles are enriched from his point of view of\nbeing a patient and inspired by the nearness of his own death. In a way,\nthey are very analogous to the much more well known recent illness and\ndeath in Chicago of Cardinal Bernadin, for these are reflections of a\npeople coming to grips with death and growing from it. In one of the\nJAMA pieces, Dr. Bone writes:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I write this to record my last months of life. I write it for myself,\nfor my family, and , I hope, for those many people in the future who\nmight find comfort in it as they also face death, Three years ago, this\ncould not have been written&mdash;at least not the way it is now. The reason\nis simple: Three years ago, I was not dying. But, even more than that, I\nhad no idea what dying is all about, although I thought I had a fair\nunderstanding of death. I saw death more times than I can count. I\nalways thought that death caused the collapse of the dying person inward\nupon himself. The dying person appeared to be little more than a\nshrunken shell lying in a hospital bed. Physical collapse meant that\nthere was a collapse of the mental and spiritual being as well.</p>\n\n<p>I know now I could not have been more wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Death has opened my eyes to life - literally.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I think you will find these articles very moving and they illustrate and\nexpress, more eloquently than I, some of the ideas that I want to\ndiscuss today, many of these ideas also informed by my own experience of\nbeing a patient.</p>\n\n<p>Today then, I would like to talk about some spiritual aspects of life\nthreatening illness and the practice of medicine. Take this as a &ldquo;work\nin progress&rdquo; without definite conclusions.</p>\n\n<p>Every life threatening illness has both danger and opportunity within\nit. We know very well of the danger and are familiar with the fear\nassociated with that danger. Most of our professional lives has to do\nwith dealing with that danger, trying to properly diagnose, treat and\nmanage it. Sometimes, though, with some patients, the &ldquo;opportunity&rdquo;\npart comes up. When it does, it is always striking, inspiring and gives\ntrue meaning to the clichs about clouds having silver linings, gold\nhidden in dark places.</p>\n\n<p>As you may know, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of two\npictographs - one for danger and one for opportunity. It is this latter\npart of the crisis of life threatening illness about which I want to\nspeak: the opportunity for spiritual growth or spiritual unfolding. The\nreal dangers and real fears of illness can defeat our souls or they can\nbe a catalyst to the inner chemistry of the unfolding of the soul. And\nthe soul, even in illness and death, can flourish and triumph.. In fact,\nI would propose that in the openness that life threatening illness can\nbring, we may be more open than at most other times in our life to\nreceiving a spiritual teaching.</p>\n\n<p>However, the subject of this talk is particularly challenging to me\nbecause, like so many professionals, I have internalized my own kind of\n&ldquo;separation between church and state&rdquo; , mostly keeping professional\nlife and spiritual life separate. It is as if there has been within me\nand within my practice of medicine a boundary that is analogous to the\nkind of boundary we have had in western civilization for the past few\nhundred years between science and religion.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent issue of Natural History Magazine, the evolutionary\nbiologist and paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould has an article in which\nhe argues that science and religion have eliminated much conflict by\nmutual recognition that each has teaching authority or professional\nexpertise over non-overlapping domains: the empirical constitution of\nthe universe is the professional expertise of science while the search\nfor proper ethical values and the search for spiritual meaning is the\ndomain of religion.</p>\n\n<p>The net of science covers the empirical universe: what it is made of\n(fact) and why does it work this way (theory). The net of religion\nextends over questions of moral meaning and value and these two\n[domains] do not overlap&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>To put it more simply, the turf has been divided. The scientists have\nthe physical world, the material world and randomness as a basic (and\nuseful) assumption. Questions of meaning and purpose are not considered\nto be scientific. In science, teleological questions, questions with a\n&ldquo;Why&rdquo; before them, are generally considered inferior questions.\n&#47;&#47;00000112&#47;#_ftn2&gt;[2] Religions have the turf of meaning and\nvalues. So if you want to know &#39;why&#39;, don&#39;t go to a scientist, go to\na clergyman.</p>\n\n<p>However, Gould goes on to say:</p>\n\n<p>&hellip;these two [domains] bump right up against each another,\ninterdigitating in wondrously complex ways along their joint border.\nMany of our deepest questions call upon aspects of both for different\nparts of a full answer - and the sorting of legitimate domains can\nbecome quite complex and difficult. Medical training and medical\npractice is mostly applied science. Whether\nit is physical, biological science or so called &ldquo;behavioral science&rdquo;,\nthere is little training or even &ldquo;official&rdquo; recognition that human\nbeings are not only physical and psychological beings, but even more so,\nspiritual beings. That would be a tough assertion to make on medical\nrounds: it is so vague and unverifiable, unquantifiable and we doctors\nare nothing if not eminently concrete and practical. Remember, most of\nthe advances in medicine in this century come from the realm of science,\nand that has been what has been emphasized in our training. Think about\nmodern antibiotic, vaccine, not to mention surgeries, organ transplants,\nkidney dialysis and so on, treatments, which we consider routine, that\nwould have been considered miraculous in any other era in human history.</p>\n\n<p>When we become ill, or suffer any kind of tragedy or sorrow, though, we\noften begin to ask in earnest, &ldquo;why&rdquo;. Science is very good at\nanswering &ldquo;how&rdquo; questions: how infection with this bacteria or virus\nled to these symptoms or how high blood pressure and high cholesterol\nlevels led to this coronary plaque and to this MI. If a person asks\n&ldquo;why&rdquo; to his physician, to one of us, and you listen very carefully to\nthe physician&#39;s answer, you will hear disguised &ldquo;how&rdquo; answers most of\nthe time. For the &ldquo;why&rdquo; answers you need to go to a clergyman, the\nchaplain, perhaps, or to a guru. But if they are honest with their\nexplanations, they too will leave some open space, a space that\ncorrelates with the degree of inscrutability they attribute to God, the\ndegree to which they have been affected by modernism, the degree to\nwhich they are comfortable &ldquo;not knowing.&rdquo; For &ldquo;why&rdquo; questions are\nquestions of meaning and science has little to offer in this regard.\nHowever, with traditional religious &ldquo;answers&rdquo; regarding meaning open\nto question today, we most often need to discover meaning somewhere\nwithin us. Certainly others can help us and the wisdom carried by\nreligions is available to us, but skepticism is also one of the\ncornerstones of the scientific mind and skepticism is part of the legacy\nof our age. So not only doesn&#39;t science give us the &ldquo;why&rdquo; answers, it\ntends to undermine the traditional &ldquo;why&rdquo; explanations of religion.</p>\n\n<p>But we humans need to know why we suffer. It was Nietzche who said,\n&ldquo;He\nwho has a why to live for can suffer any how.&rdquo; And, therefore, much of\nthe spiritual work associated with illness is in this dimension\ndelineated by &ldquo;why&rdquo;. It is in the realm of meaning and this realm of\nmeaning is in an orthogonal dimension to the realm described by science.</p>\n\n<p>So the subject of this talk does make me edgy.. But, it is at this\n&ldquo;orthogonal&rdquo; border where these two domains &ldquo;bump right against each\nother&rdquo; that I want to take us..</p>\n\n<p>Do imagine for a moment that we are at this borderline, this &ldquo;no\nman&#39;s\nland&rdquo; between science and religion, the material and the spiritual, the\nsecular and the sacred for life threatening illness very quickly brings\nus into this borderland.</p>\n\n<p>In one of the articles you have, Dr Bone writes four &ldquo;observations&rdquo;,\nwhich, I would propose, come from his experience in this borderland:</p>\n\n<p>1. Good health is often taken for granted; however, it is the most\nprecious commodity one possesses.</p>\n\n<p>2. One&#39;s spouse, children, family, and friends are the essential\ningredients that allow one to endure an experience such a as a serious\nunexpected illness.</p>\n\n<p>3. When faced with death, one recognizes the importance of God, and\none&#39;s relationship to God.</p>\n\n<p>4. The things that one does throughout one&#39;s life that seem so urgent\nare, most of the time, not so important.</p>\n\n<p>For myself, this borderland became intensely real one summer afternoon\nwhen I found my way into the Emergency Room here at Evanston Hospital\nwith chest pains, flat on my back and very rapidly, went from doctor to\npatient, and, almost, corpse in the course of about thirty minutes. All\nof a sudden, the doctor role dropped away and something much more\nessential was revealed. Something we all know, but can easily forget in\nour professional lives. It was that before we are doctors and patients,\nwe are all people. We are all souls.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, one of the major themes that I want to raise for us to think\nabout this morning, is that of boundaries and boundary crossing. It is\nnot the boundaries between countries or states that I am addressing, but\nthe boundaries we often draw between professional life and spiritual\nlife, doctor and patient, illness and health, mind and body, psyche and\nspirit, even life and death. I, for one, have lived within fairly strict\nboundaries, trying to keep things neat and tidy. It doesn&#39;t always\nwork. I doubt that it works very well for you either. I am not trying to\nsay that boundaries don&#39;t serve a useful purpose: they do. If you are a\nphysician, for example, and trying to maintain a reasonable family life,\nyou have to draw boundaries somewhere. There are important boundaries\none often needs to draw in caring or not caring for family members. So,\nthis is not a challenge to all boundaries. But, to experience\nlife-threatening illness, either as a patient, a family member, close\nfriend or a professional is potentially to find ourselves crossing\nboundaries. It is to find ourselves crossing some boundaries we may have\nthought impermeable and others which we didn&#39;t even know were there.</p>\n\n<p>For better or worse, we are living at a time when boundaries in all\nareas of life are seeming to be redrawn. This is certainly true in\nmedicine, psychology and religion. For the most part, it can be an\nunsettling experience. And we resist. However, just as the boundaries\nbetween nations that we &ldquo;see&rdquo; on a map disappear when we look at the\nreal thing, like the earth from space, many of the boundaries that we\nwill be speaking of disappear when we look with a larger perspective.\nAnd, encountering a life-threatening illness can give that larger\nperspective.</p>\n\n<p>In psychological terms, the close encounter with death makes us\nvulnerable and potentially more open than we may be at any other time.\nFamiliar identity is challenged. One&#39;s self-image is no longer fixed.\nThe ground upon which we stand moves like an earthquake and we can feel\nto be in a free fall. We no longer can take things for granted, but out\nof that chaos can come a new perspective. For the &ldquo;taken for granted&rdquo;\nis also often another way of being unconscious, another way of living in\nignorance of the every day miracle we call &ldquo;life&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>A patient dying of AIDS said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&#39;t want this, and I hated this, and I was terrified of this.\nBut it turns out that this illness has been my greatest gift. Now every\nmoment is precious to me. All the people in my life are so precious to\nme. My whole life means so much more.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In Greek mythology, Hermes, the Messenger of God, is the traditional\ngod\nof boundaries and traffic over them. He is the guide of souls through\nthis transitional space, for we never travel alone. Humans have always\nhad guides through the ages, though we may understand them differently\nin different eras. Murray Stein, a Jungian analyst in Chicago, in a\nsomewhat different context, says that Hermes &ldquo;represents a type of\nconsciousness that exists essentially within transitional time and\nspace&rdquo; &hellip; and he refers to this condition as &ldquo;liminality&rdquo;.\nLiminality refers to the Latin limen, meaning doorway or threshold. And\nit is the image of the door, along with that of boundaries, that I want\nus to imagine. In the experience of life threatening illness, we cross\nthresholds, enter doorways. We go from the familiar to the unfamiliar,\nfrom the known to the unknown. Not just patients, but doctors and\nnurses, too. Sometimes, it is quite literally a different place, like a\nhospital, but more so it is a different psychological space. And Hermes\naccompanies us though I do not mean this literally, but symbolically. We\nhave deep, though often unconscious programming that is part of our\nendowment as humans. Call it the &ldquo;collective unconscious,&rdquo; as Jung\ncalled it, or &ldquo;archetypal consciousness&rdquo; as some of the transpersonal\npsychologists would call, or &ldquo;Divine Aid,&rdquo; as religions have called\nit, but we are not alone. For some this is concretized in the image of\nJesus or Elohim or that of the Divine Mother. For others, it may Great\nSpirit or the Prophet. We are not alone. It has something to do with\nfaith.</p>\n\n<p>Another dying patient said:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When you&#39;ve come to the edge of all the Light you know, and you are\nabout to step off into the Darkness of the Unknown, Faith is knowing one\nof two things will happen&mdash;there will be something solid to stand on or\nyou will be taught how to fly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>So illness brings us into a world of doors and boundaries and we are\naccompanied by some form of the &ldquo;Messenger of God&rdquo;, in our travels.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, I need to back off a little in this domain.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose that it is pretty weird for me as an internist to be talking\nabout illness in this way during Medical Grand Rounds. For our whole\ntraining in medicine is mostly focused on disease processes, diagnosis,\nand treatment, pathophysiology. The physician-patient encounter is\ntaught as one in which you get the &ldquo;history&rdquo;, whose purpose is to\nferret out from the symptoms a pattern which is recognizable as a\ndisease, and then do the &ldquo;physical examination&rdquo; and order laboratory\ntests. It is applied science. And, of course, we love it. But, many a\npatient finds it an unsatisfactory, incomplete experience, for there is\na lot more going on in the patient role than just a conglomeration of\nsymptoms. We all know that, but how do we address it, practically\nspeaking? To relate only through scientific training seems to me to be\nlimited. For in the face of life-threatening illness, there is a great\nhunger for spiritual attention. It is often a time when we are very\nopen, but it is often unrecognized and unaddressed. We can just look at\nthe list of best sellers by physicians Deepok Chopra, Bernie Siegel,\nAndrew Weil, Larry Dossey and Scott Peck, just to name a few, over the\npast few years to see some measure of that huge hunger. We can see it in\nthe rise of alternate medicine, where people spend billions of dollars,\nmost of it &ldquo;out of pocket&rdquo;, not covered by medical insurance.</p>\n\n<p>So I think that though it may be weird to be speaking this way as an\ninternist, when I cross any other boundary and see myself as a patient,\nor as just a human being, it is not. Indeed, this may be a cutting edge\nof medicine in the future, a counter movement to the industrialization\nprocess now underway called &ldquo;managed care.&rdquo; For managed care has\nhelped us cut expenses but it does so by bringing in the same kinds of\nthinking that have been successful in other businesses and slowly, but\nsurely it moves medicine more and more into the world of mass production\nand standardization. This is an impersonal world, and while it may have\ncertain advantages, even in medicine, it is not likely to address\nspiritual needs. So, it brings with it a counter movement and this\ncounter movement has spirituality at its core.</p>\n\n<p>In doing a medline search for this talk, I came across a fascinating\nPresidential Valedictory Lecture given to the British Royal College of\nPsychiatrists in 1993 by Andrew Sims. Titled &ldquo;&#39;Psyche&#39; - Spirit as\nwell as Mind?&rdquo;, he admonishes psychiatry for ignoring the spiritual\nexperience of patients and goes on to say:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The great taboo at the start of this century was sex, but it is now\nthe last resort of the burnt out comedian. The unspeakable in the middle\nof the century was death, and now teaching about bereavement has even\ncome back into undergraduate medical education. What is unmentionable at\nthe end of the century is the personal experience of religious faith&hellip;.\nYet spiritual concepts are, for many thoughout the world, a perfectly\nordinary part of everyday existence.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>So it is in the spirit of breaking this taboo, in the spirit of\ncrossing\nboundaries, and in the spirit of sharing that I want to tell you a story\nof a day when I crossed the line from doctor to patient. And it\ncertainly seems appropriate to share this experience here.</p>\n\n<p>The experience, which I would like to share, is that of a heart attack\nand cardiac arrest which was in August of 1995. It is an event, a date,\nthat has a &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; quality to it, the way all\nlife-threatening experiences have. A friend who has had stage 3 breast\ncancer and is surviving after the harrowing treatment that has included\na bone marrow transplant, dates her &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; to the\ntelephone call in which the surgeon told her biopsy results and\nprognosis. Sometimes it is a well-defined moment like that: an abnormal\nmammogram, a chest x - ray, blood in the stools, results of a blood test\nor an MRI scan. But it could be a pain, the swerve of the automobile, or\nthe smell of smoke. In Dr. Bones&#39;s JAMA piece, &ldquo;The Taste of Lemonade\non a Summer Afternoon&rdquo;, he starts out by describing his first symptom,\nthe passing of blood in his urine on Christmas Day. Think about how many\nof these &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; events we as physicians participate in?\nThink how patients often describe them in a story-like way that can seem\nto have little relevance to us, as we abstract out the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; that we\nseek in the &ldquo;history of present illness&rdquo;. How routine they can become\nto us, how easily ignored. How conscious are we of the meaning, the\nsignificance to the patient of what we often so casually may say?</p>\n\n<p>At other times the &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; is not so clearly related to an\nevent but an inner realization. And though that realization is complex,\nit partly a realization that nothing is ever going to be the same again.\nIt is also the realization: I am going to die. It may pass. The disease\nis cured, we may forget, deny, repress, whatever words seem appropriate.\nBut, we are not the same anymore. From a spiritual point of view, we\nhave been initiated into finiteness&mdash;into the human condition. Before,\nwe knew we were going to die, but death was more of a concept than a\nreality. Now we know. There is a Zen saying that &ldquo;In the face of real\nexperience, concepts are like snowflakes falling on an open fire.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>All of this is true not only for the person who is ill, but also for\nall\nof those close to him or her. The effects of a life-threatening illness\nspread out like waves on water when a stone is thrown in. The closer we\nare to someone, the more profoundly we are touched by it and everything\nsaid just now applies. The whole family goes through these experiences:\nadults, children, even pets. Co-workers, acquaintances, patients,\nclients. The opportunity for the teachings of life-threatening illness\nto be received, extend to all of us. We don&#39;t necessarily need to\nexperience everything first hand to learn from it. And we who work here\nin this hospital are also affected, much more than we may even be aware.</p>\n\n<p>As I tell this story, I would like to try and tell it in a way that you\nactually are there. For, though it is my story, it is actually a story\nthat occurs day in and day out, in this form or a somewhat different\none. Therefore, it is a universal story as well. I am going to try and\nsay it in second person, using &ldquo;you&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I&rdquo;, though I might\nswitch back and forth a little. But, the overall intent is for you to\ntry and imagine yourself in this.</p>\n\n<p>August 20 was a hot Sunday in Chicago. You were off that weekend,\nthough\nthere were some telephone calls from the emergency room and from\npatients in the morning. One was from a patient who was in Wisconsin, a\nfew hours away, and who was having chest pains. She had been evaluated\nby your associate in the previous week and he didn&#39;t think it was\nanything serious but she was having them again and was frightened. So,\nafter some discussion, you said that it was safe for her to drive back\nto Evanston and come to the emergency room. You spoke with the ER about\nher and another patient, who you had never seen but was the mother of\none of your patients, and you agreed to care for her if she needed\nadmission for what turned out to be a fractured pelvis. You were\nsomewhat annoyed that all this activity had taken place on a rare day\nwhen you were &ldquo;off&rdquo; but it is hard for you to answer a telephone and\nsay &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&#39;m not here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I am in a three-person practice of internal medicine and the summers\ntend to be very busy, for the simple fact that it seems as if one of us\nis on vacation all the time so that you are covering each other&#39;s\npractice when you are not yourself on vacation. The preceding week was\nextremely stressful because of a tragic death of a friend&#39; s son in\nCincinnatti. He was 28 years old and died in the severe heat of an\nasthma attack. We had driven to Cincinnatti for the funeral and back in\ntwo days. It was very sad, emotional and physically taxing. In\nretrospect, you remember stopping at McDonald&#39;s on the way there and\nback and drinking thick chocolate shakes and eating French fries. In\nCincinnatti, you had a uncharacteristic breakfast of fried eggs, hash\nbrowns and bacon or sausage. These are the kind of details you remember\nlater, when you read more recent studies on coronary artery plaque\ninstability.</p>\n\n<p>Well, on this hot Sunday afternoon, you went to Lake Michigan, which is\na few blocks from your home and read the Sunday Tribune and stood in the\ncool water. After about an hour you went into the Northwestern athletic\ncenter to work out, and though you felt rather washed out, you did a\nwork out, of sorts, on a life cycle, a rowing machine, and using some\nweights. In the shower, though, you began to feel very weak and shaky\nand started sweating profusely. You began to feel pain in both your\nforearms. At this point, you got slowly dressed and walked upstairs to a\nvending machine to get a cranberry drink, thinking that you were\nexperiencing a hypoglycemic reaction, remembering you had not had lunch.\nYour thoughts were very slow.</p>\n\n<p>You bought the drink, sat down to drink it and the can felt extremely\nheavy. You could barely lift it. A sip didn&#39;t do any good. You started\nto think that something serious was going on, and even that you should\ncall for help and get to the hospital. But, you were embarrassed by the\nthought of causing a big stir here, and also you couldn&#39;t really\nbelieve that anything that serious could be going on. You slowly walked\nout the building into the heat and you needed to sit down in front of\nit, when you saw one of the medical residents from the hospital coming\nin to exercise. You thought to call out to her to help but before you\ncould say anything, she was gone into the building. It was steaming hot\noutside and your brain just said, &ldquo;Get home.&rdquo; You walked slowly to the\ncar and drove home. All the while, pains were coming up from your arms\ninto your chest. You passed Evanston Hospital, going down Central\nStreet, thinking that you should turn in there, but when you passed it,\nyou couldn&#39;t even imagine how to turn around and go inside. So you\ncontinued another few blocks to home, where you pulled in the driveway,\nleft your gym bag in the car, walked in, lay down on the bed, and told\nyour older son to call 911, that you were having chest pain.</p>\n\n<p>The paramedics were there in a few moments and were giving you\nnitroglycerin and so on. They were calling in to the ER and talking\nabout elevated ST segments. You can still remember some of your thoughts\nas you lie there, getting obvious relief from the nitroglycerin tablets\nunder your tongue. But you were thinking that their field equipment\nwasn&#39;t that accurate and that they were overreading and making it more\ndramatic than it was.</p>\n\n<p>Denial? Did I hear anyone out there think denial? Who me(?),&mdash;who knew\nevery step of the way what was going on, but couldn&#39;t really accept it?\nAt that time I just could not cross the boundary between health and\nillness, being &ldquo;normal&rdquo; and mortally ill. Part of me just couldn&#39;t do\nit. Granted, it lasted only 15 to 20 minutes, but denial is denial. How\ndo we cope with such bad news? It is hard sometimes to see that\neverything is changed, and to adapt. How many older patients have we\ncared for who needed hospitalization but who, so irrationally, didn&#39;t\nwant an ambulance to take them from their home? A few months ago, I was\ncalled to care for a patient in the ICU who was in a coma on a\nrespirator, had gained 80 pounds of fluid in a few weeks in the effort\nto keep her blood pressure up, had bowel necrosis and raging infections,\nwhose abdominal incision had shown not the slightest granulation one\nweek post op, but whose daughter was still wondering about an infusion\nof massive doses of vitamin C the day before she finally accepted that\nher mother was going to die. My real job in this case was not to try and\nget this patient better&mdash;much more competent physicians and nurses than\nI had been working on that&mdash;but to work with her daughter&#39;s denial. I\ncould now understand a little better her denial, that this (her\nmother&#39;s death) truly was unthinkable.</p>\n\n<p>But when we let in the &ldquo;unthinkable&rdquo; is that not also an expansion of\nconsciousness? Is that not what spiritual unfolding is all about? Is\nthis not &ldquo;growth&rdquo; of the soul? Do we not have to expand our sense of\nacceptance, expand the heart, in order to grow from suffering, in\ngeneral? (The spiritual heart. I am not talking about ventricular\ndilatation!)</p>\n\n<p>You remember so vividly your youngest son, 11 years old, coming in the\nroom&mdash;you know, the one who you are having difficult times with. And he\nsays, &ldquo;I love you, Dad&rdquo;. Then you know you must look pretty bad. As\nyou were wheeled outside to the ambulance, which seemed so RED in the\nsun, and driven to the ER, another boundary was crossed. You had been in\nthis ER literally thousands of times over the past 13 years, but never\nhad you seen it from this angle, flat on your back. You were now a\npatient and it is not so easy for a doctor, so used to being in control,\nto be flat on his back, a patient. You had a strange feeling,\nremembering being a baby, wheeled in a carriage. Perhaps, that was the\nlast time you were wheeled in somewhere, feeling this helpless.</p>\n\n<p>The first person you remember seeing in the ER was your patient from\nWisconsin, who you sent there hours earlier with chest pain. You had\nforgotten about her. She looked at you in total amazement and in a few\nmoments, her husband peeked into your stall to verify that indeed, it\nwas you. You were no longer the doctor &ldquo;in control&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>In the ER, you believed the doctors when they said you indeed did have\nST elevations and were having an anterior myocardial infarction. The\nnitroglycerin did help and you loved them, looking forward to the next\none. You are asked to rate the pain. This is one of those things that\nhelps to understand how things are going. You are thinking, this is\npretty bad, but my kidney stone was worse, so you gave it an &ldquo;8&rdquo;. You\nare now getting intravenous lopressor, aspirin and the heparin was\ngetting started. One of the medical residents, who you knew well from\nsupervising him for two years in clinic, and who is a very funny guy,\ntells you that he needs to do a rectal exam since they are starting\nheparin. You remind him to be sure and check the prostate at the same\ntime. You shift into humor mode. Dave, the ER doc keeps asking you to\nrate the pain, and you think it got as low as a &ldquo;4&rdquo;. Time, though,\ntime was getting very compressed in the intensity of everything.</p>\n\n<p>In a few moments, you felt a little light-headed, but more than that,\nyou heard a sound that sounded like cicadas. It was that high-pitched\nsound they make in the summer. You asked Dave what that sound was, and\nhe said, with a voice tinged in anxiety and comfort, not to worry, for\nit was the sound people hear when they run lidocaine in quickly. Oh, you\nthought, lidocaine - you must be having an arrhythmia.</p>\n\n<p>And that was your last earthly thought. Almost.</p>\n\n<p>For in the next moment, you were transported to a different world, a\ndifferent zone. It is difficult to describe, but it was both dark, black\nactually, but luminous. You know it can&#39;t be both but it was. There\nwere three lights or figures that were like stars but were more figures\nthan stars. It was extraordinarily quiet and peaceful. It was like every\nmuscle relaxed and every care was removed. There was a sense of\nmovement, going toward the figures, being carried in that direction. It\nis not easy to describe this. There was no sense of time. It was like\nwaking up out of a sleep, and, like going to sleep when you take a nap\nin the daytime. It was very vivid.</p>\n\n<p>And then, Dave, who is about 6 feet 4 inches and 220 pounds, is about\nsix inches from your face, tears in his eyes, very emotional. He seems\nto be very excited, yelling, &ldquo;Bob, we got you back. You were in\nV-fib!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>You remember looking at him, feeling very strange, thinking, is he all\nright? Then he said, &ldquo;Did you see the white light?&rdquo; Still feeling very\ncalm and ironic, you said, &ldquo;No, but I was going up the black tunnel.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This all seemed slightly humorous at the time, even if it was a\ngallows-type humor. But, isn&#39;t that how we cope? I sure do. How many\nFriday afternoons have you signed out to one of your partners, your\nsides aching from laughing so hard at the sign out&mdash;this laughter a\nhealthy substitute for the tears you would shed during the week if you\nweren&#39;t so emotionally controlled.</p>\n\n<p>You lay there on the ER bed and it strikes you what has just happened,\nhow close you just were to being gone forever and that it could happen\nany time again. The beach, the sunny afternoon, your home, your\nfamily&mdash;all seem so distant, so far away. A multitude of feelings from\nall the various reaches of your being come in. Conscious, unconscious,\nautonomic, primordial. Foremost was this feeling of wanting to live,\nfeeling that it was not your time yet. You felt &ldquo;in the middle of\nthings&rdquo;, not ending. You felt lonely. Would you ever see your wife and\nchildren and friends again? You began to decide what prayer to say, for\nafter 22 years of daily spiritual practice, there were a lot of\npossibilities. Then, out of the depths from some unconscious place came,\nsomething you had never said before. It was simply: &ldquo;If it be Thy Will,\nIf it be Thy Will.&rdquo; And with it came a sense not just of surrender, but\nof sacred submission. A feeling that you had never quite had before&mdash;at\nleast like that. It was a total stripping away of the feeling of having\nany power or anything; but with it, came surrender and a feeling of\npeace. And this came up from some unknown depths, for on the surface was\na big component of fear. Over and over again, silently, you said, &ldquo;If\nit be Thy Will.&rdquo; The difference between life and death at this point\nfelt as slim as flicking a switch on and off. It was on now, but how\nlong, and who held the switch was beyond me.</p>\n\n<p>From there came the cardiologists and your partners and your spouse and\nwe went into the cardiac cath lab which you saw from such a different\nangle. An angiogram diagnosed a totally occluded left anterior\ndescending artery. It was amazingly quickly and efficiently done and an\nangioplasty guide wire was passed and the first balloon inflated. The\npain came back.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone thought this was great since it indicated viable myocardium.\nYou asked how long one needed to keep the balloon inflated and learned\nan update of one of those basic life lessons: &ldquo;Well, we&#39;ve learned\nthat the longer we can keep it inflated, the better the results.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; you thought, &ldquo;but just give me an idea of how long you&#39;re\nthinking.&rdquo; &ldquo;About 20 minutes.&rdquo; It helps to know how long, but with so\nmuch at stake, they could have said three hours and you would have said\nfine. You felt total confidence in whatever they said. When the\ninflations were over and the pain stopped, an intra-aortic balloon pump\nwas left in the aorta for the next two days. It was noticeable only if\nyou paid attention to a kind of blip in the chest&mdash;a stronger heart\nbeat.</p>\n\n<p>The CCU nurses were like angels. Not ethereal angels, but kind of\nlivesaving types. You began to feel things were going to work out. The\nangioplasty was successful in opening up the artery and even though\nthere is another 90% lesion in a smaller obtuse marginal vessel, there\nwas a general feeling of relief and of having passed through the worst\nas night came.</p>\n\n<p>Later, after a few days, when things were settled, you asked for a book\nto be brought to the hospital which was Meister Eckhart&#39;s sermons. You\nneeded to read the one he had written called &ldquo;Blessed are the Poor&rdquo;,\nwhich is an exegesis on &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is\nthe Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; It said it all. It was in &ldquo;having nothing,\nknowing nothing, wanting nothing and being nothing&rdquo; that we recognize\nthe extent to which we live by God&#39;s grace. And while this could have\nbeen just good luck, or just good medical care, it had a different\nfeeling to it as well&mdash;another dimension, orthogonal to the others, and\nit was that of being blessed by God&#39;s grace. Which, of course, despite\nour chronic complaining of how bad things are, is there, unrecognized,\nall the time.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings us to the original title of this talk when it was given in\nSt. Louis: &ldquo;Dying to Live&rdquo;. I thought it was kind of a catchy title\nbecause it has so many possible meanings. First, is in the sense when we\nsay in a kind of slang exaggeration, like on a hot day, &ldquo;I am dying for\nan ice cream.&rdquo; , meaning &ldquo;I really want ice cream&rdquo; or &ldquo;I really want\nto live&rdquo;. And that is applicable here: &ldquo;I was dying to live&rdquo; - &ldquo;We\nare all dying to live.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>But, dying to live also points to something else. It points to one of\nthe basic universal, archetypal themes, and that is the theme of\nresurrection: out of death, comes new life. It is the ultimate religious\ntheme, but it is a medical theme as well. Isn&#39;t that what surgery and\ngeneral anesthesia is all about? In some sense we &ldquo;die&rdquo;, become\nunconscious, and, if all goes well, we are resurrected with a diseased\npart gone or a new hip.</p>\n\n<p>But resurrection only comes after something dies. It comes after we\nhave\nlet go of something. After we have let go, first, of the way we thought\nthings were supposed to be. We all have expectations, a kind of model in\nour minds of how life should go. My own experience is that much of this\nis unconscious but we become aware of it when things stop going our way,\nwhen the expectations are not met. And , we need to let go. Letting go\nof what we want, what we thought was going to be, and, instead,\naccepting what is.</p>\n\n<p>So much easier to say than to do, and it is not a one-time thing, but a\nprocess. It is something that all health professionals help facilitate\nall the time, but it is not always a conscious process.</p>\n\n<p>If we are, as many religious people would say, &ldquo;spiritual beings on a\nhuman path,&rdquo; having this experience of being human in order to learn\nwhat we need, then what we have been given, is what we need. I know this\nis a very hard thing to say, and I would never say it like this to\nsomeone else. But, I do try to apply it to myself and when I have seen\nothers understand their suffering in this way, true resurrections\noccur&mdash;not always the physical resurrection that one would have really\nwanted, the cure, the remission, the restoration of function&mdash;but other\nthings. We learn to let go of past grudges, forgive others, forgive\nourselves, open ourselves, break out of the self - centeredness that\nhas, unknowingly, trapped us and kept us disconnected in a deep sense.\nOne of my favorite songs, by Leonard Cohen, has the chorus:</p>\n\n<p>Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering. There\nis a crack, a crack in everything. That&#39;s how the light gets in.\nThat&#39;s how the light gets in.</p>\n\n<p>To learn to love better, we need to let go of so much. The spiritual\nword for that is renouncement. Renouncement not as self-denial, but as a\nway of relating better; letting go of unnecessary baggage. Symbolically,\nrenouncement is the opening of our grasping hand. [DEMONSTRATE]\nReconciled to being finite, to having a limited lifespan, we connect\never stronger with the great flow that we are a part of. Call it the\nuniverse or God or history or nature. It is everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>I want to read a section from journal which was written at\nThanksgiving,\n1995. It elaborates a little more on this theme of renouncement, a theme\nthat is central to the spiritual path I have followed over the past 25\nyears.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This morning, riding out to Glenbrook Hospital, I did a calculation.\nIt is 95 days since my heart attack and cardiac arrest. I see this as a\n&quot;second life&rdquo;, one I almost did not have. This part of my life feels\nlike a gift. It also gives life a &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; quality. We are all\nliving on &ldquo;borrowed time&rdquo;, though it is rare to think of it that way.\nMostly we feel ownership of our time, of our lives. We own them. This is\ncertainly better than to feel we are living as if someone else owned\nthem. Too many people - perhaps most - have that experience. But,\nneither do we really own our lives either: we have been created. The\nfirst part of my life was a gift, too, but I never really saw it quite\nthat way.</p>\n\n<p>The spirit of renouncement is to realize one never truly owns anything.\nWe are responsible for things, for our actions, thoughts and so on. We\nshould be stewards, responsible caretakers, for the world&#39;s wealth. But\npossession is always temporary and this temporariness is easily mistaken\nfor permanence. Can I give thanks with my life? In some very simple,\ndeeper way, I understand (if that is even the right word) renouncement\nmore clearly. We are born and die naked. In between, what matters are\nour connections, relationships with the Whole. The Whole includes all\nthe parts, what theologians call the Immanent, what we might call\n&ldquo;daily life&rdquo;. The Whole is not something separate from the parts.&ldquo;</p>\n\n<p>On the one year anniversary of the heart attack, I worked out at\nNorthwestern, the scene of it all beginning that day. After my run, for\nrunning has become my current discipline (surprise!), I showered in the\nsame shower stall as I when I first experienced the sweating, the\nweakness and the arm and chest pains. Who should walk in but Tim, the\ncardiologist who did the angiogram and angioplasty that day. I briefly\nsaid hello and reminded him of the anniversary, which he acknowledged.\nThen, as I looked up at the clock, I saw it was 6 P.M., the exact time\nof that angioplasty, for I remember that the balloon was inflated for\ntwenty minutes, beginning at 6 P.M. and that during this time all of the\npain came back. I watched the clock from the cath table very carefully.\nThe coincidence of this meeting in the shower, one year to the minute\nseemed and seems more than just a random coincidence. For me, it had the\npower of somehow proving the very existence of God. But, as a doctor, a\nscientist, how can you say such things, except in an ironic voice. Even\nnow. It is as if that boundary between science and the spirit once again\nshows itself.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the Chicago Tribune ran a piece by Saul Bellow, the\nNobel prize winning author. In 1993 he suffered a life threatening\nillness which was a poisoning of his central nervous system with toxin\nthat he contracted from bad fish in the Caribbean. He spent a month in\nthe intensive care unit in Boston, with a very long recovery period. He\nshared his reflections at a medical conference in Chicago. Amongst other\nthings, he said:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;In preparing my talk, I rejected at once the temptation to tell a\nconvention of doctors how to conduct themselves with their patients. A\nteam of doctors at Boston University hospital saved my life two years\nago. Some of them seem to have taken my survival seriously, but I would\nsooner have them effective than compassionate. That is, if I were to\nhave a choice&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>No one can tell doctors what to do. &hellip; We can&#39;t possibly tell human\nbeings, adults, to be caring, compassionate, sensitive; to interact, to\nenter into intimacies from therapeutic motives, et cetera.</p>\n\n<p>No other person can value your life as you do. Nor should you demand or\neven expect such a valuation from anybody else&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He describes in some detail how his senior neurologist was deeply\ninvolved with his recovery. The part that came after survival was no\nlonger the issue. He says:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The doctor&#39;s outlook&mdash;or if you prefer, his ideology&mdash;is humane,\nbut his training is in science, and science does not see nature as\nhaving a soul. But the neurologist, Dr. X, did have a soul. He was\ncapable of compassion, although in nature there is no compassion, so he\ncame early in the morning and late at night and on the weekends.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And as I work as a physician, I hear those words very clearly.\nCompassion is important, but only if it accompanies being effective. We\nstill need to make the diagnosis, give the best treatment and often,\nassemble the best team of specialists and sub-specialists to help our\npatient. And there are many ways to go about it.</p>\n\n<p>And so as we end, I think we are back to acknowledging boundaries, even\nas we acknowledge that we pass through them. At this point in time, I\naccept ambivalence and acknowledge that there are no easy answers, at\nleast for me. For me, death remains the ultimate mystery or potentially\nthe doorway to the ultimate mystery. But I do know the value and the\ntruth of renouncement and the joy and necessity of living life to its\nfullest.</p>\n\n<p>I want to leave with the following poem which I wrote during the few\nweeks off after this experience. It poses a challenge that I still feel,\ntrying to live better in this &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; of a life.</p>\n\n<pre><code>The Loom\n\n\nTime passes and everything changes,\nBut nothing changes very much.\nFour Ancient Women are weaving the Life-times,\nHere.\nThe Loom is as big as a galaxy,\nThe threads are invisible to us, but have\nSomething to do\nWith Cause and Effect.\nThreads, connecting threads between lives\nAnd deaths,\nConnections, relationships, synchronicities,\nBut mostly,\nUnseen.\nWe&#39;re too busy to notice, too much to do.\nLife is work or else,  sleep or else unconsciousness.\nIs there another way?\nCan one get a glimmer of the threads now and again and live\nIn the Weave?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>{: .pretty}</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p><tt> Dr. Robert Magrisso is an internist in practice in Winnetka,\nIllinois, an Associate Medical Director for the Palliative Care Center\nof the North Shore, and on the staffs of Evanston Northwestern\nHealthcare and Northwestern University Medical School. </tt></p>\n
6	The Gift of Love	Ruth McCarthy	On April 21, 1995, my husband died after a long, painful illness. My\nchildren and their families arrived home that day. The next morning, I\nhad a heart attack and was flown to Rockford by helicopter. My sons had\njust lost their father and they weren't sure if they were going to lose\ntheir mom, too. I was under sedation for the next three days after an\nangioplasty, which caused me to miss my husband's funeral.\n\nAfter a week, I came home and I did well until June 30, when I felt\nlight-headed and realized my heart rate was up. I called my doctor's\noffice because they were due to close shortly. I was told to get to the\nemergency room right away and have someone drive me. My son Dan was\nthere so he drove me to the local hospital, five minutes away.\n\nAs soon as I got to the emergency room, I was suddenly light-headed\nagain and then unconscious.

7	Donna's Dream:  An After-Death Communication	Donna N.	Last summer I read "Hello From Heaven" after I had an incredible dream\nregarding my Mom who passed on April 29, 2002. (Below is the\ndocumentation of my dream.) I was searching for understanding and this\nbook helped me. I have received many "gifts" and messages that I\nattribute to my Mom. I know that Mom is with me in spirit. As a matter\nof fact, when ever I get really lonely for her and feel down I hear her\nvoice (in my soul) say to me, "I am still with you honey." Then peace\ncomes over me and I feel just fine. Here is my dream:\n\nSunday night, June 16, 2002, midnight. This was a dream that I will\nnever forget. The following simple words cannot adequately describe what\nI experienced. I was in the presence of Mom and we were looking over the\nmost beautiful scenery that I have ever seen. It was not a familiar\nsetting. This scene appeared more beautiful than our "earthly"\nsettings, almost as if an artist added some incredible special effects\nto make all the colors, all the life, reach out and touch you. I\nremember vibrant colors, varying shades and intensities of greens,\nblues, lavenders, reds, every color that we know but much more intense,\nluminescent, iridescent.

Mom conveyed, to\nme in ways beyond words, "yes it is so, so beautiful, just beautiful."\nWe were excited to be sharing in the vision and the senses of this\nbeautiful scenery. Then, I saw Dad. At about the same time Mom\ncommunicated to me, "Oh look there is your Father, oh he is having so\nmuch fun! Look at how happy he is." She expressed this with incredible\nlove and caring for Dad. I watched Dad and he was smiling and laughing\nand enjoying himself. Dad was sitting with his right arm resting on a\ntable.

It was almost as if Mom enlightened me or helped me to\nunderstand.\n\nAt that moment of understanding I woke up. As I woke up I was trying to\ngrasp on to the dream, trying to remember "the message/the\nenlightenment" that Mom conveyed to me right before I woke up, but the\ndetails quickly faded away from me.

(Below is the\ndocumentation of my dream.) I was searching for understanding and this\nbook helped me. I have received many &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; and messages that I\nattribute to my Mom. I know that Mom is with me in spirit. As a matter\nof fact, when ever I get really lonely for her and feel down I hear her\nvoice (in my soul) say to me, &ldquo;I am still with you honey.&rdquo; Then peace\ncomes over me and I feel just fine. Here is my dream:</p>\n\n<p>Sunday night, June 16, 2002, midnight. This was a dream that I will\nnever forget. The following simple words cannot adequately describe what\nI experienced. I was in the presence of Mom and we were looking over the\nmost beautiful scenery that I have ever seen. It was not a familiar\nsetting. This scene appeared more beautiful than our &ldquo;earthly&rdquo;\nsettings, almost as if an artist added some incredible special effects\nto make all the colors, all the life, reach out and touch you. I\nremember vibrant colors, varying shades and intensities of greens,\nblues, lavenders, reds, every color that we know but much more intense,\nluminescent, iridescent.

8	Near-Death Experiences.... They're a fact	Julia Mossbridge	Steve Fanning is a history professor who spent two weeks in a coma that\nleft him paralyzed. Once he returned to consciousness, he was\nmiraculously healed and learned to walk, this despite his doctor's\nprognosis that his walking was neurologically impossible. (Doctors and\nscientists, like most people, have trouble shifting their worldview --\neven when the facts speak loudly!)\n\nDuring his coma, Fanning had a near-death experience through which it\nwas revealed that he had to re-arrange his life. He learned he had to\nget his life in line with what really matters, which he says has\nsomething to do with "Trying not to hurt others, regardless of the\nrationalizations your ego presents to you for why they deserve it."\nFrom that point on, Fanning began listening to his conscience, ignoring\nhis ego, and began studying mysticism.\n\nNear-death experiences (ndes) may be a mystical phenomenon, but 21st\ncentury science now has enough data to draw the conclusion that the\nGolden Rule is actually a law of nature. A 2001 study published in the\nrespected medical journal Lancet dispelled one of the most common\nexplanations for ndes by proving that none of the people who experienced\nthem shared any common drug treatments, physiological symptoms, or\npsychological viewpoints. Despite having so little in common, most\npeople who have had ndes reported similar "life-changing insights,\nheightened intuition, and disappearance of a fear of death." Some of\nthem can reliably recount events that occurred when they were clinically\ndead. Many of them say that during their experience, they became aware\nthat to hurt another is to hurt oneself. So there you go: scientific\nevidence for "Do Unto Others."\n\nThis is not the only study weighing in on the validity of ndes. There's\nat least one peer-reviewed journal, The Journal of Near-Death Studies,\nfilled with them. Researchers have documented enough ndes to keep the\njournal alive for the past 15 years. That shouldn't be surprising, says\nDiane Willis of the Chicago-area International Association for\nNear-Death Studies, since more than 23 million people have had ndes in\nthe U.S. alone. That means one of every ten people you meet has been to\nthe "other side," a non-material reality that has now been\ninvestigated with rigorous scientific methods.\n\nBut there's been a PR problem for these particular scientific findings,\naccording to Dr. Neal Grossman, professor of philosophy at the\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago. He says that research on ndes proves\nthat love and connection are the guiding forces of the Universe, but\nthis research is marginalized because the greed-oriented and ego-driven\nnature of our current culture could not survive if the implications of\nnde research were taken seriously.\n\nWhen I heard this, I first thought Grossman was being a bit paranoid.\nAfter all, many scientists think their field of research is\nmarginalized. It's the whole\ngeeky-kid-gets-made-fun-of-and-can't-get-over-it scientist thing. But\nwhen I started to look at what other magazines were saying about the\nLancet piece and similar work, I saw Grossman's point.\n\nThe March 2003 issue of Scientific American ran a scathing column that\nactually used the Lancet study to argue that ndes aren't real because\nthey can be triggered by trauma (yeah, death!). But scientists aren't\nthe only ones threatened by nde research; the conservative press is\nworried as well. The September 2002 issue of The Economist stated that\nout-of-body experiences, which are often part of ndes, are not real\nbecause you can create them by stimulating the brain with electrodes.\nFunny, this implies that sensations such as fear, anger, the desire for\ncandy, and the smell of roses must not be real, since you can also get\nthese by stimulating the brain with electrodes. I suspect The Economist\ndelights in dismissing such phenomena as bunk. Why? Because to them the\nresults mean that the material world wins; greed and power can rule if\nlove does not.\n\nThis brings me back to my conversation with Steve Fanning, the history\nprofessor who began to study mysticism after his nde. At the end of our\ndiscussion, I began to get a little hopeless about the future of our\nculture. Sure, people who have been to the "other side" may understand\nthe connection among all life, but what about the other 90 percent of\nus? Then Fanning reminded me of a hopeful fact: nde isn't necessary.\nMeditative practice, study with a spiritual mentor, and/or prayer has\nhelped many people arrive at the same understanding that near-death\nexperiencers report.

9	Through the Moongate	Robert Moss	When I was nine years old, I was rushed to hospital in Melbourne,\nAustralia after complaining of a pain in my lower right abdomen. They\nfound that my appendix was about to burst. The doctors were worried\nabout my ability to survive the operation, since I had just barely\nsurvived the latest of many bouts of pneumonia. "You'd better give up\non this one," one of the doctors told my mother. "He's never going to\nmake it."\n\nUnder anesthesia on the operating table, I stepped out of my body,\ndecided I did not care to watch the bloody work with the scalpel and\nflowed through the door where the molecular stuff seemed to stretch like\ntoffee before letting my energy body through and along the corridor to\nwhere my mother sat hunched and weeping, my father's strong arm about\nher shoulders\n\nI flowed to a window, to the brightness outside, to the colors of spring\nand the laughter of young lovers seated at a sidewalk table, drinking\neach other's smiles. I felt the pull of the ocean. I could not see the\nbeach from the hospital window, so I floated through the glass and out\nonto a ledge where a blackbird squalled at me and shot straight up into\nthe air. I followed the bird and sailed over the rooftops.\n\nSoaring over the city, I saw a huge moon-round face, its mouth opened\nwide to form the gateway to Luna Park, a popular amusement park on the\nwater. I swooped down through the moongate and plunged into darkness. I\ntried to reverse direction, but something sucked me downwards. It was\nlike tumbling down a mineshaft, mile after mile beneath the surface of\nthe earth.\n\nI fell into a different world. It was hard to make out anything clearly\nin the smoke of a huge fire pit. A giant with skin the color of fine\nwhite ash lifted me high above the ground, singing. The people of this\nworld welcomed me. They were tall and elongated and very pale, and did\nnot look like anyone I had seen in my nine years in the surface world.\nThey told me they had dreamed my coming, and raised me as their own. For\nthe greater part of my schooling, I was required to dream to dream\nalone, in an incubation cave, or to dream with others, lying in a\ncartwheel around the banked ashes of the fire in the council house.\n\nYears passed. In the highest festival of the year, when the bonfires\nrose higher than the bird-headed finials of the council house, I was\nritually joined to the favorite niece of the shaman-king of this people.\nAs I grew older, my recollection of my life in the surface world faded\nand flickered out. I became a father and grandfather, a shaman and\nelder. When my body was played out, the people placed it on a funeral\npyre. As the smoke rose from the pyre, I traveled with it, looking for\nthe path among the stars where the fires of the galaxies flow together\nlike milk.\n\nAs I spiraled upward, I was entranced by the beauty of growing things,\nplunged into the intoxication of green, burst through the earth's crust\ninto a world of hot asphalt and cars and trams - and found myself\nshooting back into the tormented body of a nine-year-old boy in a\nMelbourne hospital bed.\n\nFrom this and other experiences in early childhood, I have known for as\nlong as I can remember that there are worlds beyond physical reality.\nGrowing up in a military family in a conservative era, I found there\nwere few people in waking life with whom I could safely share\nexperiences of this kind. The first person I met who could confirm and\nvalidate my experiences was an Aboriginal boy, raised in a tradition\nthat values dreaming and teaches that the dreamworld is a real world. I\nmet Jacko when I was living with my family in a rough inner suburb of\nBrisbane. We rode the trams and walked in the bush and told each other\nour dreams. Jacko confirmed that dreaming is traveling: we routinely get\nout of our bodies and can travel into the future, or into other\ndimensions, including realms of the ancestors and spiritual guides.\nJacko's uncle, a popular artist, got the ideas for his big paintings\nthe ones that were not for the tourists by going into the Dreamtime.\n\nIn my dreams, other guides came to me. One of them was a radiant young\nGreek who insisted on using the difficult vocabulary of the neo-Platonic\nphilosophers; he taught me that true knowledge comes through anamnesis,\n"remembering" the knowledge that belonged to us, on the level of soul\nand spirit, before we entered our current lives. One of my dream\nvisitors was a dashing Royal Air Force pilot from the era of World War\nII. Another of my dream friends was a large man with white hair who\nseemed like a benign uncle. During my successive crises of illness, he\nwould turn up to promise me that despite everything, I was going to make\nit through. He told me, "This may seem strange, but a day will come\nwhen people will not only listen to your dreams, they will be eager to\nhear them." He had an odd request; he wanted me to put salt and pepper\non my crumpets when my mother took me to the caf in Myer's department\nstore for afternoon tea in the midst of her shopping expeditions. This\nwas noted as just one more of my boyhood oddities.\n\nMy Greek visitor showed me a serpent of living gold, wrapped around a\nstaff, and told me that this sign would heal me. Walking home from\nschool, aged eleven, I saw a stormy sky open to reveal the same image\nblown up to colossal proportions. After this, my series of\nlife-threatening illnesses ceased.\n\nAs I followed my dreams in adult life, I found that it was possible to\njourney into multidimensional reality without undergoing the ordeals of\nmy boyhood: that every night, in our dreams, gateways open into realms\nof limitless adventure and possibility. Many decades later, I returned\nto Australia from my new home in upstate New York to teach dreamwork\ntechniques to large audiences.\n\nAt an exhibition of Aboriginal art in a Sydney museum, I found myself in\nfront of a wall of paintings that depicted, rather exactly, the beings I\nhad encountered when I went flying through the moon-gate of Luna Park.\nThey were the work of an Arnhem Land artist, who called the pale\nelongated forms he had painted "mimi spirits". He said that when he\ngets sick, he goes to live among these spirits; when he gets well, he\nreturns.\n\nIn Melbourne, I went to Myer's department store, to eat crumpets with\nsalt and pepper in the caf. I discovered that crumpets are no longer on\nthe menu. But as I glanced at myself in a mirror, I saw the big man with\nwhite hair who had visited me in my childhood, and I realized he had\nkept his promise.\n\n<i> Robert Moss is a world-renowned dream explorer, a shamanic\ncounselor, a novelist and a former professor of ancient history.

11	Grief Relief:  Visiting the Dead	Julia Mossbridge	A friend of mine died when I was in college, and I blamed myself. Josh\nwas not sure he wanted to come to the dance I was deejaying with his\nsister, but when I flirted a bit during a phone call he decided to make\nthe drive. He never arrived at the dance he was killed by a truck on the\nfreeway. I had mentally tucked away this episode until I heard of a new\ntechnique that uses communication with the deceased as a way to heal\nunresolved grief.\n\nI was pretty sure I didn't have any residual grief about Josh's death.\nIf anything, I felt only guilt about the role I played in it.\nNonetheless, I wondered if I could ask Josh's forgiveness for my role\nin his death. So I called up the doctor who developed this technique,\nAllen Botkin, who does his work in Lincolnshire, Illinois.\n\nWhen I walked into Dr. Botkin's office, I was a little taken aback. I\nguess I had imagined some sort of high-tech machine in a darkened room\npresided over by a lab-coat clad, bearded, and eccentric character.\nInstead, the first thing I saw was a two-foot long white stick with a\nblue marker cap on it. Now really, I thought is this it?! A magic wand\nfor seeing dead people? And Dr. Botkin himself, far from a mad scientist\ntype, looked like he belonged at a softball game, giving tips to kids in\nan avuncular, arm-around-the- shoulder sort of way.\n\nDespite my misgivings, I sat down and listened to his description of\n"Induced After-Death Communication," which he developed by modifying a\nbiofeedback technique in which the eyes quickly go back and forth. The\ntheory behind this approach is based on the observation that during\nrapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, the brain is able to make associations\nand process information more quickly than during normal waking hours.\nImitating REMs in the waking hours is believed to activate the same sort\nof speedy processing and associative leaps that were previously only\nattainable during dream states.\n\nDrawing on the decades he spent at the Veteran's Administration\ntreating soldiers with severe grief and trauma, Dr. Botkin explained\nthat each client must be moved from the more superficial emotions anger,\nguilt, and shame into the core sadness that he believes is the root\ncause of the other emotions. He claimed that using his modified\ntechnique (www.induced-adc.com) people can safely move through their\nsadness and release it. Further, about 70 percent of his clients\nexperience after-death communication (ADC) reconnecting with the\nbereaved person in a realistic, joyful, inner vision.\n\nAs he described the methodology for me in his frank, no-frills way,\nevery one of my intellectual bells went off to tell me that he was\npulling my leg. At the same time, I had a strong gut feeling that said\nhe was onto something. Being a good scientist, I trusted my gut. I let\nhim do a short session with me, even though I told him I had no grief.\n\nOne minute later, after simply looking at the moving wand and listening\nto him gently ask me to get in touch with my grief, I was filled with\nimages of my last fateful interaction with Josh. I watched some more\nwaves of the magic wand and started to cry, seeing images of his death.\nAs my sadness began to wane, I got in touch with a happy memory of Josh.\nThen I closed my eyes and actually had an ADC.\n\nSimply, without pretense, I saw Josh walk out from behind a door. My\nfriend jumped around with his youthful enthusiasm, beaming at me. I felt\ngreat joy at the connection but I couldn't tell whether I was making\nthe whole thing up. He told me I wasn't to blame and I believed him.\nThen I saw Josh playing with his sister's dog. I didn't know she had\none. We said good-bye and I opened my eyes, laughing.\n\nThe experience seemed too simple, too light. There were no trumpets, no\nbright tunnels, just a conversation with Josh. Dr. Botkin had mentioned\nthat people are surprised by how "normal" ADC seems; I certainly was.\nHe also mentioned that neither the therapist nor the client has to\nbelieve in the validity of ADC for it to heal grief is resolved through\nthe reconnection, whether real or imagined.\n\nLater I found out that Josh's sister's dog had died, and it was the\nsame breed as the one I had seen in my vision. Yet I still don't know\nwhat's real. What I do know is that when I think of Josh, I no longer\ndwell on the images of me calling him or of his car getting hit.\nInstead, I see Josh walking toward me, laughing and playing with an\nangel dog.

15	Life After Death: A Journey Beyond	Holly Ingram	Many times we as nurses may have pondered life after death, be it in\nreference to our patients or ourselves. The name of the higher presence\nmay differ, but most religions are based upon the notion that our souls\ngo somewhere after we leave our human forms. I have participated in\ncodes for patients in the ED and I've wondered what might be happening\nto them as they enter the realm between life and death. Are near-death\nexperiences real? Are there second chances? I wonder no more.\n\nOn Aug. 25, 1998, I had spinal surgery to correct flatback syndrome, a\ncondition caused by the Harrington rods that were placed in my spine 20\nyears ago to correct scoliosis. The surgery was scheduled to last about\n10 to 12 hours, but things didn't go as planned. Five hours into the\nsurgery, something went wrong. I had been taking large doses of several\narthritis medications and injectable steroids preoperatively. Most\nlikely because of these drugs I started to bleed heavily. To stabilize\nme the physicians gave me large amounts of fluids. When it was all over,\nI had received nine liters of normal saline and 15 units of blood,\nplatelets, albumin, and fresh-frozen plasma. Still my heart rate was 240\nbeats per minute and my blood pressure was only 70 on palpation.\n\nMy lungs filled with fluid, and I was in fulminating pulmonary edema. My\nphysicians had to stop the procedure and were unsure whether I would\nsurvive. Several hours after the surgery, I awoke intubated to hear a\nfull description of what had happened and that I was in critical\ncondition. Luckily, before I heard this discussion I had already wiggled\nmy toes and moved my fingers and had assured myself I was okay.\nListening to the graphic description was rather shocking, but I felt\nfairly well and went back to sleep. I awoke many times that night\nchoking on the fluid in my lungs, in need of suctioning. I noticed the\nfluid was blood-tinged, but I was too drugged to be terribly concerned.\n\n## The Journey\n\nThe next morning - I know it was morning because I could see the\nsunlight from windows in my room - I was trying to get my bearings when\na strange feeling came over me. I closed my eyes. At first I felt a\ncoldness in my legs, then it slowly moved up my body. Next I felt no\npain. I could no longer feel the respirator breathing for me. I no\nlonger felt my three large incisions, nor was I any longer aware of\nhaving my hands tied to the bed. It was as if none of what had happened\nto me existed. All the tubes and drains, all the machines and noise were\ngone. Once the coldness covered me completely, a feeling of peace,\ncomfort, and love enveloped me. I had never felt anything like this\nbefore. There are no words to describe just how I felt.\n\nThen, someone started to talk to me. I say "He" but there was no\ngender or form to the presence. "He" explained what had gone wrong and\njust how sick I was. I had wanted to end my life before the surgery\nbecause of all the pain, disability, and depression. "He" let me know\nthat "He" was aware of how hard I had fought. "He" was satisfied and\nassured me I could also be satisfied that I had tried my best. "He"\noffered me a choice and had come to show me what death was like and that\nthere was nothing of which to be afraid. The way I was feeling at that\nmoment would be how I would feel for eternity. The pain and suffering\nwould be over. I could rest if I were to go with him. The feeling was so\nwonderful, so peaceful, so calm, so perfect.\n\nAlternatively, I could return to the world of the living and work my way\nthrough the pain and long recovery. It was made clear to me that nothing\nelse would go wrong, if that were my choice. I was overwhelmed by this\nwonderful state. There was no way I was going to turn my back on it.\nYes, I was ready to go! Yes, I had had enough! Yes, I had fought the\nbest fight I could and was more than willing to follow and enjoy this\nfantastic new experience. I was instructed to just close my eyes and\nfollow. Funny, they were already closed, but I visualized them closing\nin my mind.\n\nJust as my lids were coming together the face of my eight-year old\ndaughter flashed before me. I had had a brief thought of my husband\nearlier but discounted it immediately. As a grown man, being left alone\nwould be hard, but he would be able to survive without me. My daughter,\nno! Nor my son! My eyes flew open in my mind and I started to scream\n"NO, NO, NO, I will NOT! I will not leave my children."\n\n## The Return\n\nDo not ask me how I know, but at that moment I felt a smile. I did not\nsee a face but I felt the smile and its warmth radiate through my whole\nbody. I had not been influenced directly; I had been allowed to make my\nown decision, but something put the image of my daughter before my eyes.\nI had become rather self-centered before the surgery. The struggle to\nkeep living was my entire focus and my family had taken a back seat. The\nwarmth stayed with me for a short time.\n\nThen, suddenly, with a jolt, I could hear and feel all the machines\nagain. The pain had returned. My hands were tied. The respirator\nwhooshed. I opened my eyes and could see the hospital room. The first\nreal day of my long recovery had begun. I spent several more days on the\nrespirator until the fluid cleared from my lungs. One week after the\nfirst surgery, I returned to the OR and they finished the surgery. I\nbled again and needed six more units of blood, but I knew I was in no\nreal danger. I was being watched over the whole time. Miraculously I\nwent home from the hospital four days postoperatively to celebrate my\ndaughter's ninth birthday the following day.\n\n## Not Again\n\nThree weeks postop, while rolling over in bed, I dislocated two disks in\nmy neck. I endured the pain for another three weeks before returning to\nthe hospital. The pain was terrible and nothing could control it. They\ntried morphine and more than 40 trigger-point injections. I screamed in\nmy head, "You lied to me." I was angry and disappointed. I had not\nbeen told the whole truth. I knew my recovery would be long and hard. I\nknew it was going to take all my strength to accomplish, but I had been\nled to believe nothing else would go wrong. Yet here I was in horrible\nshape again looking at cervical fusion surgery. How could this have\nhappened? I felt so abandoned.\n\nIt took time for me to realize that I had not been abandoned at all. I\nwas being given a reminder. I had been treated to a special gift. I had\nlived through it and had forced myself to forget about it as soon as it\nwas over. I had not learned my lesson. What lesson? The lesson that I\nshould share my experience and not be ashamed of it. I should use my\ngift, the best I could, to assure others that death is not really\nsomething to be feared.\n\nBut I had been embarrassed to talk about it. I thought it was hokey.\nAlthough I had always wondered if near-death experiences were real, now\nthat I had had one, I rejected it. It took even longer for me to be able\nto freely talk about it to others. Once I did, I could see the comfort\nin their faces as I described the sensations and total state of peace,\nas the tears streamed down my cheeks.\n\nYes, I was meant to talk about it, share it. Many people have told me\nhow much better it has made them feel to hear my story. For the dying,\nit validated their hopes and beliefs. For their families, it gave\ncomfort and made their own grief less, knowing their loved ones were\ngoing someplace - a place full of love and peace. I assured them that\ngrieving is for the living, not the dead. We all miss those we lose.\nThat pain is real, but those who leave us enjoy a state the living do\nnot experience.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\nSome people say when one door closes another opens. Most of the time\nit's hard for the person involved to see any good behind a loss or\nmajor change. My surgery meant I could no longer be an ED nurse. I now\nhave many restrictions in my life.\n\nED nursing was my life and my soul. It was who and what I was. The loss\nwas devastating to me. For a long time I had no idea what I would do\nwith the rest of my life. The hardest part of my physical recovery took\none year, though I am still learning how to adapt my life.\n\nBut through it all I have not been alone. "Chance" led me to a new job\nas a clinical researcher working on a national drug study. I have shared\nmy experience with nurses, lab technicians, the hospital chaplain, and\nsome of my patients' families, when appropriate. I may not be an ED\nnurse anymore, but I am a better, more open and forgiving person. And\nthat makes me a better nurse. I found my open door.\n\nHolly Ingram, RN, CEN, works for Fusion Clinical Trials, Middletown, NJ.\n\n<i> Reprinted with permission of Nursing Spectrum magazine.

She is\na founder and facilitator/trainer for the Renewing Life program in\nhospitals across the country, which helps people to make the most of\nlife when dealing with a life-threatening or chronic physical illness.\n</tt>\n\nWhen I was 16 years old, I was operated on for lumps in both sides of my\nneck. These were removed, and I was told I had cancer, but that they\nthought they got it all. At 18 years old, I had a series of tumors down\nthe right side of my neck, so my local surgeon referred me to a well\nknown thoracic surgeon in New York City. I had radical neck surgery and\nI kept complaining I couldn't breathe, but everyone around me assured\nme it was the pressure dressing on the wound, and I should go back to\nsleep.\n\nFollowing that surgery, at seven o'clock that night, I lay\nsemiconscious in bed no longer complaining when the doctor came in to\ncheck on me. I had no blood pressure! The doctor yelled at me to breathe\nand kept telling me to breathe for each breath, while he cut me open in\nbed, hoping to remove the blood clot on my trachea. He could not reach\nit, and so I was rushed into surgery again, but not given any anesthesia\ndue to my critical condition.\n\nWhile in the operating room, I found myself on the ceiling watching them\noperate on me below and hearing what they said. I kept thinking, "Why\nare they so frantic? I'm just fine," and then I realized I was on the\nceiling watching them. I got scared, and in that same moment found\nmyself in a tunnel, like a swirling cloud with brilliant glistening\nlightness. I also had a guide. I didn't see him, but I felt his\npresence and heard his voice. I felt peaceful, accepted, whole. As I\nwalked down this tunnel toward a brilliant white light, my ears were\nringing and scenes from my life passed before my eyes. These were not\nbig moments or events in my life, and were certainly not moments I would\nhave picked out as representative of my life. They were moments of\nloving another. Moments of shared intimacy. Moments in which I had\ntouched another in their deepest heart. Moments of shared unconditional\nlove. Moments in which it had made a difference that I had been there\nfor another person. There were only a few of these moments in my 18\nyears of life.\n\nAs I neared the end of the tunnel, there was an archway with people on\nthe other side that were welcoming me. They were people I knew who were\ndead: a grandmother, other grandparents, an uncle, great-grandparents,\netc. I recognized them.\n\nAgain I must mention, that even at all this I felt no fear. I felt\nperfectly safe, peaceful, complete, totally all right. At this\nthreshold, my guide told me that this was death. This guide also told me\nit was perfectly all right for me to choose to go there if I wanted to\nrest, but I would have to come back another time in another life and\ncomplete the lessons of this life. In addition, I would have to\nrediscover these lessons, as they would be unknown to me in a new\nlifetime, just as they had been to me in this lifetime up until now.\n\nOr I could choose to go back into this lifetime, to learn more about my\nlessons. It was clear to me that my lessons were to be with others in\nsuch a way that it made a difference. To touch them in their deepest\nheart, to live within the hearts of others, to be a reflection in their\nlives long after my body died. This was the legacy that I was to leave.\nI now had a choice to stay and be with those on the other side of the\narchway, or to come back to further gain an understanding of my lessons\nfor this lifetime.\n\nI chose to come back, and I began to become conscious of my body, my\nbreathing, pain, light, voices. I had no anesthesia, as I said before.\nThe doctor kept asking for my blood pressure. The nurse said, "It's\ngoing Up?!!" with much surprise. I was told days later that they never\nexpected me to make it. My doctor told me that my heart never would have\ntaken it had I been older than 18. I have had my spiritual guide ever\nsince. I didn't tell the doctors I chose to come back, and that's why\nI made it. In fact, I didn't tell anyone about this experience for five\nyears, until I heard someone else talk about a near-death experience.\n\nIt was not until I heard Dr. Stanislov Grof talk about near-death\nexperiences and the rights of passage, that I began to share the\nspiritual part of this experience. He spoke of research into all kinds\nof cultures and the similarities of near-death experiences, and how\nthese experiences were created and used in Native American, Indian,\nOriental, and Christian cultures to awaken people spiritually. I\nrealized I was not alone in having found a spiritual guide, and that I\nwas not crazy! I began to share my experiences and trust my guide.\nLater, I trained more with Dr. Martin Rossman and Dr. David Bressler,\nwho taught me to access my inner physician. Later, I heard of Louise\nHays' Mirror Work which I had been doing on my own for years. Now, Dr.\nBernie Siegel speaks about using guided imagery for healing and\nspiritual awakening. One need not go through a near-death experience to\nlearn to access a higher power. People do it in prayer, meditation,\nvision quests, guided imagery, mirror work, and other forms.\n\nIn my own life I have continued to use my inner guide for direction and\nguided imagery for healing. It's nice to know others have proven it\nworks.\n\n<i>Story Copyright 1991 by Ingrid Dilley, Carol Troestler, and Josiah\nDilley.

12	Dead Reckoning:  Scientists Weigh the Scientific and Spiritual Facets of NDEs	Mark Sauer	When Deb Foster died in a La Jolla hospital, she found herself on a\nstairway surrounded by cats and dogs and mesmerized by a celestial blue\nsky, the likes of which she had never seen on earth.\n\nMary Clare Schlesinger hovered above her bed in the intensive-care unit,\nwatching her husband and daughter react in shock and fathomless grief at\nthe thought of her passing.\n\nBeverly Brodsky said she went on a spectacular journey through a tunnel\nof intense light, a magic ride with angels and a shapeless God to a\nplace of perfect knowledge, wisdom, truth and justice.\n\nAll three said the journeys on which they embarked while "clinically\ndead," a period of a few moments when their hearts stopped, transformed\ntheir lives and left them with no fear of death.\n\nThey are not alone.\n\nMany patients -- a notable study says nearly one in five -- who are\nrevived following cardiac arrest report memories of their brief time at\ndeath's door. They undergo a lucid, often indelible experience, even\nthough they were unconscious with flat brain scans during the moments in\nwhich their hearts were still.\n\nThe near-death experiences, or NDEs, described by the three San Diego\npatients contain many of these typically reported elements:\n\nAn out-of-body experience; acute awareness; moving through a void or\ntunnel toward bright light; meeting deceased relatives; a life review;\nfeelings of intense joy, profound peace -- a feeling so blissful they\nlonged to remain; and seeing a point of no return.\n\nIncreased survival rates from faster responses to cardiac-arrest calls,\nextensive CPR training, development of portable defibrillators and other\nimproved methods of resuscitation mean more and more people could be\nexpected to have near-death experiences.\n\nThough it may sound like the stuff of supermarket tabloids or the latest\nNew Age religion, NDEs are attracting the attention of distinguished\npractitioners who study both the body and mind.\n\n"Some may say this is the brain's survival mechanism, that there is a\nphysical explanation," said Dr. Vivian Ellis, an obstetrician at\nScripps Memorial Hospital who resuscitated Deb Foster after assisting\nwith her Caesarean section.\n\n"But I think there is definitely a spiritual aspect to this," said\nEllis. She has practiced obstetrics at Scripps for 15 years and said she\nhas had several patients who reported NDEs to her.\n\n"Whatever happens, it is more than science. This raises fascinating\nquestions about human consciousness, and about light and time."\n\nYet many physicians remain skeptical about near-death reports.\n\nDr. Robert Sarnoff, a pulmonologist who revived Mary Clare Schlesinger\nat La Jolla's Green Hospital in February 2001, said that in 25 years of\ntaking care of gravely ill patients, she was the only one who has\nreported an NDE.\n\n"It is not a big topic on my radar screen," Sarnoff said.\n\nOther San Diego cardiologists and trauma specialists declined to even\ndiscuss the subject.\n\nDr. Pim van Lommel said he often encounters this response from\ncolleagues.\n\nHe is a cardiologist in the Netherlands who led a 13-year study of the\nNDE phenomena. The results were published in 2001 in the respected\nBritish medical journal Lancet.\n\n"NDE is not a rare phenomenon," said van Lommel in an e-mail\ninterview. Yet NDEs are, to many physicians, "an inexplicable\nphenomenon and hence an ignored result of survival in a critical medical\nsituation."\n\n"Physicians must be open and must take the time to listen to patients\nwithout prejudice."\n\n##  A most serene place\n\nAfter her baby was delivered by Caesarean section on Dec. 11, 2002, Deb\nFoster was wheeled into a recovery room. As attendants moved her from\ngurney to bed, something awful happened.\n\nShe suffered an amniotic-fluid embolism, a rare obstetric emergency in\nwhich amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream, passed into her lungs and\ncaused cardiac arrest.\n\nFor more than three minutes, the then-42-year-old, who already had a\ntoddler at home, was clinically dead. Though unconscious, Foster says\nshe had the most clear and profound experience of her life:\n\n"I left that room and went to a staircase that was going up into the\nsky. It was so high, up past the clouds. I am afraid of heights, but I\nhad no fear, even though there were no railings," she said.\n\n"I could look off to the distance and see beautiful rolling hills. The\nsky was the most unimaginable color of blue that doesn't exist in this\nlife."\n\nFoster started crying as she described this beauty.\n\n"There is simply peace. No chaos. No pain; the most serene place you\ncan imagine, a perfect moment in time."\n\nFoster said she believed in God but questioned her faith and was\nuncertain about an afterlife before this experience.\n\n"Now there is no question in my mind; there is a God, there is a\nheaven."\n\n##  Scientific analysis\n\nVan Lommel noted that the effects of NDEs "on patients seem similar\nworldwide, across all cultures."\n\nHe said he became interested after reading the book "Return From\nTomorrow" by George Ritchie, an Army private who in 1943 was revived\nafter "dying" from a bout of pneumonia.\n\n"I started to ask patients who had survived a cardiac arrest if they\ncould remember something" from when they were unconscious, van Lommel\nsaid.\n\nThat led to a study of cardiac patients who had lapsed into\nunconsciousness because of anoxia (deficiency of oxygen) at 10 Dutch\nhospitals between 1988 and 1992.\n\nThe patients ranged in age from 26 to 92; 75 percent were men. Most were\ninterviewed within five days of being clinically dead.\n\nOf 344 patients, 62 -- or 18 percent -- remembered something of the time\nthey were dead, van Lommel said.\n\nTwo-thirds of those (41 patients) had a "core," or extremely vivid,\nNDE while the other 21 were determined to have had a superficial NDE, he\nsaid.\n\nDr. Ellis of Scripps said the fact that most resuscitated patients do\nnot report NDEs may be likened to the fact that some people vividly\nremember dreams while others have no memory of them at all.\n\nSurviving patients in van Lommel's study who reported NDEs were\ninterviewed again at two- and eight-year intervals, and compared with a\ncontrol group of patients who did not have the experience.\n\nResearchers were struck, van Lommel said, by how the NDE patients had\nbeen transformed.\n\nNearly all had no fear of death, believed in an afterlife, and strongly\nbelieved that what was truly important in life was "love and compassion\nfor oneself, for others and for nature."\n\n"What might distinguish the small percentage of patients who report an\nNDE from those who do not?" van Lommel asked. Neither the duration of\nthe cardiac arrest, or unconsciousness, or differing resuscitation\ntechniques had any effect on the frequency of NDE.\n\n"Neither could we find any relationship between the frequency of NDE\nand any administered drugs, fear of death before the arrest,\nfore-knowledge of NDE, religion nor education."\n\nResearchers ranging from those with scientific degrees to devotees of\nthe paranormal to practitioners of New Age religions agree that the\nphenomenon of near-death experiences raises more questions than can\ncurrently be answered.\n\nOne is: If NDE is physiologically based, why doesn't every patient who\nrecovers from cardiac arrest/coma report them?\n\nAnother is, if patients whose hearts and brain activity have stopped\nremember vivid experiences, what does that say about the origin of the\nconscious mind?\n\nOne thing is certain, van Lommel said: "The NDE is transformational,\ncausing profound changes of life and insight and loss of the fear of\ndeath."\n\n##  A perfect light\n\nIn 1970, when Beverly Brodsky was 20 and living in Venice, Calif., the\nmotorcycle she was riding on was hit by a car driven by a drunk.\n\nBrodsky, who is married with a grown daughter and is retired after 28\nyears as a federal employee, said she suffered severe head injuries and\nlacerations to her face.\n\n"They released me from the hospital with no pain medication. I was in\nagony."\n\nThough raised in a Jewish family, Brodsky said she was an agnostic at\nthe time. As she lay in bed, Brodsky said, she feared she would pass out\nfrom the pain.\n\n"I wanted to die. I remember praying: 'God, if you are there, take\nme.' With that prayer, I was lifted up out of my body. I had these\nterrible head injuries and pain, and I had been legally blind before.\nBut suddenly my eyesight was perfect.\n\n"On the ceiling was an angel in flowing white robes that glowed from\nwithin, like a lantern. I believe I was clinically dead at that point.\n\n"He took my hand, and we flew out the window. I had no fear. We were\nover the ocean, and above us was this dark area. At the end of it was a\npinpoint of light, brighter than anything I had ever seen. It was like a\ntunnel, and we went into the tunnel.\n\n"It was a light that contained all things; everything that ever was or\nwill be was in this light.\n\n"There were no words, no form, no face, no structure. All communication\nhappened telepathically. I thought, well this isn't the guy on the\nSistine Chapel ceiling, but this must be God."\n\nBrodsky has three shelves of books about NDE in her Chula Vista home.\nShe moderates a monthly meeting for those who have had such experiences\nand is active in national NDE groups.\n\n"I have never come to doubt my experience," she said. "I see it as a\ngreat gift from God. I'm honored I was allowed to remember."\n\n##  Glimpse of afterlife\n\nLong relegated to the realm of the paranormal, NDE burst on the scene 30\nyears ago when Raymond Moody, an East Coast psychiatrist, published\n"Life After Life," examining reports of near-death experiences -- a\nterm Moody coined. It sold 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nOther books and articles and studies followed, including several by\nKenneth Ring, now professor emeritus of psychology at the University of\nConnecticut and co-founder of the International Association for\nNear-Death Studies (IANDS).\n\nRing studied thousands of NDE reports, including some by blind patients.\nHe concluded that religious orientation was not a factor. An atheist was\nas likely to have one as someone devoutly religious, according to Ring,\nwho retired from the NDE field in the late 1990s.\n\nRegardless of their backgrounds, most patients were convinced they were\nin the presence of some supreme being and loving power, and had glimpsed\na life yet to come.\n\nRing, who concluded NDEs do not have the rambling, disconnected nature\nof hallucination, said patients who reported them came away with strong\nfeelings of self-acceptance, a great concern for others and more\nappreciative of life -- more loving and more spiritual.\n\n##  The power of love\n\nMary Clare Schlesinger is among the apparent minority who do not see\nreligious overtones in her near-death experience.\n\n"I had an out-of-body experience. But I see it as part of life, not a\nreligious experience," said the 56-year-old Escondido woman. She\nsuffered respiratory failure four years ago from complications due to\npost-polio syndrome and a severe virus.\n\nSchlesinger said she was placed on life support in the intensive-care\nunit and realized she was dying. "Time suddenly became very important.\nI could slow it down or speed it up," she said.\n\n"Time slowed down, enabling me to go through all of my life and\nconsciously forgive everyone who had ever hurt me. Then it was easy to\nlet go."\n\nSchlesinger, who was raised Roman Catholic, said that from her perch in\nthe hospital room, she looked down and clearly saw herself in bed and\nher husband and daughter at her bedside.\n\n"I saw Dr. Sarnoff come into the room, and I knew I had a chance; I\nknew he could bring me back. I saw Steve and Rebecca, saw how shaken my\ndaughter was, and I decided to come back.\n\n"It was not as if I were weighing a choice, though. As soon as I saw\nRebecca and Steve's faces, all the energy and strength available went\ninto coming back.\n\n"I had incredible peace and acceptance. ... It is a different kind of\nenergy, strength and power. Survival was more about love. The love I\nhave for life and the people I love and the love they have for me is\nvery powerful."\n\nWhen she had recovered and returned home, Schlesinger wrote a poem about\nher experience, which concludes: "... my heart and soul into one/a\nunion of love becomes ME."\n\n##  Skeptics weigh in\n\nNDEs can be explained by neurochemistry and are the result of brain\nstates that occur due to a dying, demented or drugged brain, notes\nRobert Todd Carroll in "The Skeptics Dictionary."\n\nCarroll cites British researcher Susan Blackmore's conclusion that the\nfeelings of extreme peacefulness -- almost universal among NDE reports\n-- are the result of endorphins released due to the extreme stress of\nthe situation.\n\n"There are two basic hypotheses," said Paul Kurtz in an interview. He\nis a retired philosophy professor, well-known secular humanist and\nfounder of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of\nthe Paranormal, one of the nation's largest skeptics' groups.\n\n"One, something leaves the body, the spirit or soul, goes to another\nrealm, returns and reports. Two, this is a physiological process that\nalters consciousness, triggers bright lights, tunnel vision, out-of-body\nexperiences and the like.\n\n"That latter makes much more sense to me."\n\nVan Lommel concedes that "neurophysiological processes must play some\npart in NDE."\n\nSimilar experiences can be induced through electrical stimulation in\npatients with epilepsy, he noted, and are seen with "cerebral hypoxia,\nas in rapid acceleration during training of fighter pilots."\n\n"Also, NDE-like experiences have been reported after the use of drugs\nlike ketamine, LSD or (psilocybin) mushrooms." But the perception of\nlight, sound flashes and recollections with drug use are more fragmented\nand far less panoramic than that of an NDE, he said.\n\nMost compelling to van Lommel and many other NDE researchers is what the\nexperience suggests about one of the great medical mysteries -- the\nnature of human consciousness.\n\n"Traditionally, it has been argued that thoughts or consciousness are\nproduced by large groups of neurons or neuronal networks," van Lommel\nsaid. "How could a clear consciousness outside one's body be\nexperienced at the moment the brain no longer functions during a period\nof clinical death?"\n\nThe suggestion made by van Lommel and other NDE researchers is that the\nmind may not entirely be the product of matter. And "at the time of\nphysical death, consciousness will continue to be experienced in another\ndimension."\n\nVan Lommel said he likes to compare our brains with computers: "The\nInternet is not produced by the computer, but received by it. And in the\nsame way, our brain functions as a receiver, not as a producer, of\nconsciousness."\n\nThere are still more questions than answers, he acknowledged.\n\n"We finally should consider the possibility that death, like birth, may\nwell be a mere passing from one state of consciousness to another."\n\nMark Sauer is a Staff Writer for the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\n<i> <tt> This story appeared in the San Diego Union-Tribune on Sunday,\nMay 1, 2005, Lifestyle Section, page E-1, in Editions 1,2,3.

They undergo a lucid, often indelible experience, even\nthough they were unconscious with flat brain scans during the moments in\nwhich their hearts were still.</p>\n\n<p>The near-death experiences, or NDEs, described by the three San Diego\npatients contain many of these typically reported elements:</p>\n\n<p>An out-of-body experience; acute awareness; moving through a void or\ntunnel toward bright light; meeting deceased relatives; a life review;\nfeelings of intense joy, profound peace &ndash; a feeling so blissful they\nlonged to remain; and seeing a point of no return.</p>\n\n<p>Increased survival rates from faster responses to cardiac-arrest calls,\nextensive CPR training, development of portable defibrillators and other\nimproved methods of resuscitation mean more and more people could be\nexpected to have near-death experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Though it may sound like the stuff of supermarket tabloids or the latest\nNew Age religion, NDEs are attracting the attention of distinguished\npractitioners who study both the body and mind.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Some may say this is the brain&#39;s survival mechanism, that there is a\nphysical explanation,&rdquo; said Dr. Vivian Ellis, an obstetrician at\nScripps Memorial Hospital who resuscitated Deb Foster after assisting\nwith her Caesarean section.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But I think there is definitely a spiritual aspect to this,&rdquo; said\nEllis. She has practiced obstetrics at Scripps for 15 years and said she\nhas had several patients who reported NDEs to her.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever happens, it is more than science. This raises fascinating\nquestions about human consciousness, and about light and time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Yet many physicians remain skeptical about near-death reports.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Robert Sarnoff, a pulmonologist who revived Mary Clare Schlesinger\nat La Jolla&#39;s Green Hospital in February 2001, said that in 25 years of\ntaking care of gravely ill patients, she was the only one who has\nreported an NDE.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is not a big topic on my radar screen,&rdquo; Sarnoff said.</p>\n\n<p>Other San Diego cardiologists and trauma specialists declined to even\ndiscuss the subject.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Pim van Lommel said he often encounters this response from\ncolleagues.</p>\n\n<p>He is a cardiologist in the Netherlands who led a 13-year study of the\nNDE phenomena. The results were published in 2001 in the respected\nBritish medical journal Lancet.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;NDE is not a rare phenomenon,&rdquo; said van Lommel in an e-mail\ninterview. Yet NDEs are, to many physicians, &ldquo;an inexplicable\nphenomenon and hence an ignored result of survival in a critical medical\nsituation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Physicians must be open and must take the time to listen to patients\nwithout prejudice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2>A most serene place</h2>\n\n<p>After her baby was delivered by Caesarean section on Dec. 11, 2002, Deb\nFoster was wheeled into a recovery room. As attendants moved her from\ngurney to bed, something awful happened.</p>\n\n<p>She suffered an amniotic-fluid embolism, a rare obstetric emergency in\nwhich amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream, passed into her lungs and\ncaused cardiac arrest.</p>\n\n<p>For more than three minutes, the then-42-year-old, who already had a\ntoddler at home, was clinically dead. Though unconscious, Foster says\nshe had the most clear and profound experience of her life:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I left that room and went to a staircase that was going up into the\nsky. It was so high, up past the clouds. I am afraid of heights, but I\nhad no fear, even though there were no railings,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I could look off to the distance and see beautiful rolling hills. The\nsky was the most unimaginable color of blue that doesn&#39;t exist in this\nlife.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Foster started crying as she described this beauty.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is simply peace. No chaos. No pain; the most serene place you\ncan imagine, a perfect moment in time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Foster said she believed in God but questioned her faith and was\nuncertain about an afterlife before this experience.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now there is no question in my mind; there is a God, there is a\nheaven.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2>Scientific analysis</h2>\n\n<p>Van Lommel noted that the effects of NDEs &ldquo;on patients seem similar\nworldwide, across all cultures.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He said he became interested after reading the book &ldquo;Return From\nTomorrow&rdquo; by George Ritchie, an Army private who in 1943 was revived\nafter &ldquo;dying&rdquo; from a bout of pneumonia.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I started to ask patients who had survived a cardiac arrest if they\ncould remember something&rdquo; from when they were unconscious, van Lommel\nsaid.</p>\n\n<p>That led to a study of cardiac patients who had lapsed into\nunconsciousness because of anoxia (deficiency of oxygen) at 10 Dutch\nhospitals between 1988 and 1992.</p>\n\n<p>The patients ranged in age from 26 to 92; 75 percent were men. Most were\ninterviewed within five days of being clinically dead.</p>\n\n<p>Of 344 patients, 62 &ndash; or 18 percent &ndash; remembered something of the time\nthey were dead, van Lommel said.</p>\n\n<p>Two-thirds of those (41 patients) had a &ldquo;core,&rdquo; or extremely vivid,\nNDE while the other 21 were determined to have had a superficial NDE, he\nsaid.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Ellis of Scripps said the fact that most resuscitated patients do\nnot report NDEs may be likened to the fact that some people vividly\nremember dreams while others have no memory of them at all.</p>\n\n<p>Surviving patients in van Lommel&#39;s study who reported NDEs were\ninterviewed again at two- and eight-year intervals, and compared with a\ncontrol group of patients who did not have the experience.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers were struck, van Lommel said, by how the NDE patients had\nbeen transformed.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly all had no fear of death, believed in an afterlife, and strongly\nbelieved that what was truly important in life was &ldquo;love and compassion\nfor oneself, for others and for nature.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What might distinguish the small percentage of patients who report an\nNDE from those who do not?&rdquo; van Lommel asked. Neither the duration of\nthe cardiac arrest, or unconsciousness, or differing resuscitation\ntechniques had any effect on the frequency of NDE.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Neither could we find any relationship between the frequency of NDE\nand any administered drugs, fear of death before the arrest,\nfore-knowledge of NDE, religion nor education.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Researchers ranging from those with scientific degrees to devotees of\nthe paranormal to practitioners of New Age religions agree that the\nphenomenon of near-death experiences raises more questions than can\ncurrently be answered.</p>\n\n<p>One is: If NDE is physiologically based, why doesn&#39;t every patient who\nrecovers from cardiac arrest&#47;coma report them?</p>\n\n<p>Another is, if patients whose hearts and brain activity have stopped\nremember vivid experiences, what does that say about the origin of the\nconscious mind?</p>\n\n<p>One thing is certain, van Lommel said: &ldquo;The NDE is transformational,\ncausing profound changes of life and insight and loss of the fear of\ndeath.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2>A perfect light</h2>\n\n<p>In 1970, when Beverly Brodsky was 20 and living in Venice, Calif., the\nmotorcycle she was riding on was hit by a car driven by a drunk.</p>\n\n<p>Brodsky, who is married with a grown daughter and is retired after 28\nyears as a federal employee, said she suffered severe head injuries and\nlacerations to her face.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They released me from the hospital with no pain medication. I was in\nagony.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Though raised in a Jewish family, Brodsky said she was an agnostic at\nthe time. As she lay in bed, Brodsky said, she feared she would pass out\nfrom the pain.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted to die. I remember praying: &#39;God, if you are there, take\nme.&#39; With that prayer, I was lifted up out of my body. I had these\nterrible head injuries and pain, and I had been legally blind before.\nBut suddenly my eyesight was perfect.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;On the ceiling was an angel in flowing white robes that glowed from\nwithin, like a lantern. I believe I was clinically dead at that point.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;He took my hand, and we flew out the window. I had no fear. We were\nover the ocean, and above us was this dark area. At the end of it was a\npinpoint of light, brighter than anything I had ever seen. It was like a\ntunnel, and we went into the tunnel.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It was a light that contained all things; everything that ever was or\nwill be was in this light.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;There were no words, no form, no face, no structure. All communication\nhappened telepathically. I thought, well this isn&#39;t the guy on the\nSistine Chapel ceiling, but this must be God.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Brodsky has three shelves of books about NDE in her Chula Vista home.\nShe moderates a monthly meeting for those who have had such experiences\nand is active in national NDE groups.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have never come to doubt my experience,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see it as a\ngreat gift from God. I&#39;m honored I was allowed to remember.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2>Glimpse of afterlife</h2>\n\n<p>Long relegated to the realm of the paranormal, NDE burst on the scene 30\nyears ago when Raymond Moody, an East Coast psychiatrist, published\n&ldquo;Life After Life,&rdquo; examining reports of near-death experiences &ndash; a\nterm Moody coined. It sold 10 million copies worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>Other books and articles and studies followed, including several by\nKenneth Ring, now professor emeritus of psychology at the University of\nConnecticut and co-founder of the International Association for\nNear-Death Studies (IANDS).</p>\n\n<p>Ring studied thousands of NDE reports, including some by blind patients.\nHe concluded that religious orientation was not a factor. An atheist was\nas likely to have one as someone devoutly religious, according to Ring,\nwho retired from the NDE field in the late 1990s.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of their backgrounds, most patients were convinced they were\nin the presence of some supreme being and loving power, and had glimpsed\na life yet to come.</p>\n\n<p>Ring, who concluded NDEs do not have the rambling, disconnected nature\nof hallucination, said patients who reported them came away with strong\nfeelings of self-acceptance, a great concern for others and more\nappreciative of life &ndash; more loving and more spiritual.</p>\n\n<h2>The power of love</h2>\n\n<p>Mary Clare Schlesinger is among the apparent minority who do not see\nreligious overtones in her near-death experience.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I had an out-of-body experience. But I see it as part of life, not a\nreligious experience,&rdquo; said the 56-year-old Escondido woman. She\nsuffered respiratory failure four years ago from complications due to\npost-polio syndrome and a severe virus.</p>\n\n<p>Schlesinger said she was placed on life support in the intensive-care\nunit and realized she was dying. &ldquo;Time suddenly became very important.\nI could slow it down or speed it up,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Time slowed down, enabling me to go through all of my life and\nconsciously forgive everyone who had ever hurt me. Then it was easy to\nlet go.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Schlesinger, who was raised Roman Catholic, said that from her perch in\nthe hospital room, she looked down and clearly saw herself in bed and\nher husband and daughter at her bedside.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I saw Dr. Sarnoff come into the room, and I knew I had a chance; I\nknew he could bring me back. I saw Steve and Rebecca, saw how shaken my\ndaughter was, and I decided to come back.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It was not as if I were weighing a choice, though. As soon as I saw\nRebecca and Steve&#39;s faces, all the energy and strength available went\ninto coming back.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I had incredible peace and acceptance. &hellip; It is a different kind of\nenergy, strength and power.

10	God, Lightning & Healing Hands	Tiffany Snow	<i> "Stars!" I shouted through the thunder to the appaloosa pacing\nbehind the chain link fence. "Stars! You are always the one getting\ninto trouble! In the middle of a storm trying to find fresh grass!" As\nI let the chain of the tractor shed down with one hand, I steadied\nmyself against a wooden structure pole with the other. The horse bolted\nup the pasture, as the finger of God bolted down. That stormy day on my\nhorse ranch in Tennessee, standing in the pouring rain with my arms\noutstretched, I was struck dead by a bolt of lightning </i>\n\nNot everyone needs to be struck by lightning, or have a miracle happen,\nto understand God's will for his life. But, that is the method that God\nused to fix up one of his most broken kids: me.\n\nIt was summertime in the South. A time of good green pasture for the\nhorses, ripe tomatoes on the vine, and long drives in the country. Life\nseemed wonderfully slow for me that gracious summer; as slow as the\ndrone of the honeybees in the apple trees, as slow as the preparations\nfor the upcoming county fair.\n\nFor the first time in many years, all four of my children had come\ntogether for vacation time, and I knew that it would probably be the\nlast tick of the clock before their lives would get too busy to\nexperience this again. I was making every opportunity to show them a\nfull and adventurous summer. Life had never been so materially good! I\nwas thankful to share the riches of my new life as a new wife. We would\nswim in the pool, watch movies and ride the go-cart. We would drive the\njaguar in the country and go camping and have picnics. We would ride the\nhorses.\n\nI could overlook the growing detachment of my husband and the late night\nphone calls. I could also ignore the mysterious apathy and disdain my\noldest daughter had for me. I could overlook the bill collectors'\nconstant threats and the new expensive toys being brought home that we\ncouldn't afford. I thought I could make it through anything - hadn't I\njust survived my fourth encounter with possible death? Even the doctors\nwere amazed. The venomous spider bite had tried to shut down my\nbreathing and my heart, but the doctors knew what drugs to pump through\nme and I had made it through - and this had happened just the previous\nweek!\n\nMy husband and I had been married only a year and a half. The marriage\ncounseling would work. He would stop comparing me unfavorably to his\n"special friend" of seventeen years, telling me about her just two\nweeks ago; and for me to "just deal with it." He would stop needing\nher. He would remember he loved only me. I hoped time would blow away\nthe ominous gray clouds gathering in my personal life. I kept telling\nmyself time would help, and I would adjust again, somehow.\n\nI hoped that if I closed my eyes and wished hard enough, everything bad\nwould just disappear. Hadn't I gone through this enough times? Why did\nthis keep repeating itself? Why did I continue to make bad choices about\nthe mate in my life? One thing I had learned - that I would feel that I\ndidn't deserve this and that God had abandoned me. Then I would usually\ntry to fix things myself. When I would fail, I would then call upon Him,\nand he would bail me out, change the situation, and slowly mend all the\nbroken parts. But this time, I felt there was no way my life could be\nfixed. I was broken beyond repair. I felt I had no mission, that my life\nhad no purpose.\n\nI was so tired of starting over. For the first time in my life I felt I\nhad some material advantage, and I did not want that to change - the\nchildren enjoyed it so much, and so did I. I chose not to pray about it\n- I felt I would sacrifice my happiness for the material gain of the\nchildren and I. I had messed up my life too much, too many times. There\nwas nothing left for me. I decided I would do what my husband said, and\njust "deal with it." I would resign myself to ignoring the problems\naround me, and just struggle from day to day, with a fake smile and\nheavy heart. Love between people seemed only a faade for control. I felt\nalready dead; my heart knew no joy. I was without hope, and felt\nhelplessly broken.\n\nAlthough I refused to see the storm swirling under my own roof, I\ncouldn't ignore the rain and thunderclouds gathering outside over the\nvalley. Strong winds were blowing up the hill over the pasture. The rain\nwas pelting the garden and sounded like marbles dropping on the\nmetal-roofed sheds. I had to go check on the horses. I had to make sure\nthey were safe. That's when I ran out of time. And I would never look\nat time, and many other things, the same way again. My old life would\nsoon be over; the former anxiety ridden, hopeless person I was,\nliterally died on that summer day\n\nThe last thing I remember about the strike itself was doing an\nuncontrollable electrical "dance" as my muscles contorted this way and\nthat reminiscent of the wild gyrations of John Travolta in Saturday\nNight Fever! I felt no pain. In that split second, I turned around and\ntried to push my chest against the corner of the parked truck, knowing\nthat electrical shocks often stop the heart. Then, my eyesight narrowed\nand I felt my body slowly slide down the bumper onto the wet earth; and\nall went black\n\nThe next thing I knew, I found myself standing on nothing, way up in the\nuniverse, and there were distant colorful planets all around me. I could\nsee misty pinpoints of stars through my right arm, and when I moved it\nback and forth it made the stars look wiggly, like a reflection on\nwater. I felt dizzy. I had a sense of being able to see not only in\nfront of me, but all around me at the same time. Floating just a few\nfeet from me, I saw a man with a spirit body just like mine (no wings),\nthough he was short and had slanted eyes. He spoke to me with a voice\nthat I heard inside my own head, saying: "Don't be afraid, it's ok."\n\nOn the other side of me, another spirit person, this one much taller and\nwith chiseled facial features (again no wings), nodded approvingly at\nme. All the while, we were moving with great speed toward a great\nellipsed ball of spinning light; it was brilliantly white in the middle\nand yellowish on the outside edges. The closer we got to it, the more I\nfelt overwhelming Love; it seemed so warm and comforting, it encompassed\nmy very beinglike the security of a favorite grandfather's broad arms\nwrapped around a child as he crawls up onto his lap. How wonderful I\nfelt!\n\nWe stopped. The bright light was still far from me. I wanted to go on, I\nfelt like a magnet, irresistibly drawn. The desire to "blend" had\ngrown stronger the closer we got I knew this place was the heavenly\nthrone of God himself!\n\nWhy had we stopped? As I stood there confused, yearning toward the Great\nAlmighty beyond my reach, a glowing luminousness appeared in front of\nme. Gold and white sparkles came together in a glowing spiritual body, a\ngiant image in the shape of a man with broad shoulders. A Divine\nPresence was here!\n\nA gentle voice called out from this realm of golden sparkles massed\nbrilliantly in front of me "What Have You Learned?" he asked, in a\nnondiscriminatory and non-accusing way. The voice was so soft and\ntender, yet the presence of Divine Authority was there; I knew that it\nwas the voice of God's own son, the empowered Jesus Christ.\n\nThen - all of a sudden, life events unfolded before my very eyes! Key\nmoments where I showed anger to people, and also where I had showed\nlove, appeared like scenes out of a movie! I could feel the anger and\nhurt of the other person whenever I had been mean; and I also felt the\nanger as it rippled on through to others. I had never before faced the\nhorrid deepness of my own sin. Then, where I showed love to people, I\nfelt that too; and how much further that rippled out from person to\nperson, as a warm pulse triggering cause and effect in all things that\nwere wonderful and blessedI had never before experienced such joy!\n\nThen the presence of Christ said, "The Flesh is the Test of the\nSpiritLove Each Other." Words of wisdom imparted to me! I felt\noverwhelmed with love, and so privileged.\n\nI wanted to stay! I wanted to join myself with God's swirling life\nforce, His Essence, His Heaven, was just beyond the presence of Jesus!\nBut, I wasn't allowed to go any further. I wanted to go to God! I\nwanted to feel more Love! "Why can't I be with you now Father? Please,\nGod, Please!"\n\nI listened as hard as I could listen, waiting for His Words. Then, just\non the outside of my understanding, I faintly heard voices singing the\nmost beautiful melody I had ever heard in my whole life. I knew that\nthese were the blessed voices of angels and those joined with God, and\ncame from His Swirling Brilliant Presence, Heaven.\n\nI knew it was praise for The Father, but I just couldn't make out what\nthe words were saying. I felt so sadI knew I needed to go back to the\nearth. I knew I had to make a "better movie." How I wanted to stay!\nBut, there was also a knowing that I did have a choice in this, although\nthe desire to prove my love for God was overwhelming. Yes, I wanted to\nstay. But, there and then, I vowed to be a vessel to do only His Will,\nif he could use me. I would go back.\n\nI absolutely gave myself to him. I wanted desperately to show how much I\nloved him! His Will, not my own, would govern the rest of my life. If he\ncould use this broken piece of clay from the earth, it was all his. I\ntotally dedicated myself and surrendered all desires. Instantly, I felt\na child-like sense of wonderment as a warm flood of bliss and peace\noverpowered me, and a warm tingling sensation filled me, like warm\nliquid honey flowing from the top of my head down to my very toes! What\nwas happening to me? I did not know. Only later did I find out that this\nis referred to as the baptism of the Holy Spirit, an anointing more\ncommonly experienced on earth. At that moment I knew that I would spend\nthe rest of my earthly life showing God how much I loved him, by helping\nhis children, whom he loved. They would be shown the true identity of a\nPowerful Loving God, desiring to be supernaturally active in their\nlives. I had a mission!\n\nThe spirit on my right then talked inside my head again, and answered\nmany questions on my mind. He also taught me details about many\nwonderful and sacred things. Many of these things I am still trying to\nintegrate and fully understand. It is almost like trying to learn\nanother language without being given the basic alphabet for it. So, at\nthis point, there are deeper things I have told no one, and keep only to\nmyself. Often, when in prayer to the Father I will ask him to further my\nunderstanding on these matters, yet I get the distinct feeling that true\nunderstanding will be revealed only on a "need to know" basis. There\nwas no need to occupy myself with them right now.\n\nHowever, for some reason a seed was planted within me; a groundwork had\nbeen laid. And I knew that if he wanted me to share this information\nlater on, he would tell me, and give me the reasoning ability to\nunderstand it. In fact, many things "I didn't know I knew" end up\nbeing in the pages of the books he asks me to write, and what a joy they\nhave turned out to be to love so many people in this way, and to be\nloved back!\n\nWhile I floated there before the Christ Consciousness, the very Presence\nof Jesus, the spirit then told me something that I didn't at all\nunderstand: "Welcome to the world of healers," he said. This was a\nshock - I had no idea what that meant. I had never believed in such a\nthing! I had been ordained back in 1979 in a church that believed\nhealing had died out in the first century, and also that NDEs were\nchemical reactions released in the brain. What could this mean?\n\nAt this point the Christ went back into formless sparkles and faded\naway, and the stars and space behind his glowing features were visible\nonce again. Such effervescent beauty and colors twinkled around me, like\nbeing in the midst of a sparkling aurora borealis! So many shapes of\nheavenly bodies transfixed in the cosmos, all unique and necessary, all\nuntold distances away. Yet they felt so close that it seemed I could\nreach out and pluck them out of the sky, and carry them home cupped in\nmy hands.\n\nThe slant-eyed spirit went on and continued to teach me even more. He\npointed out different stars, planets, distant colorful swirling lights\nof all kinds, and gave names for all of them. He continued to fill me up\nand give me answers to thousands of questions that I never had questions\nfor! Reams of information seemed to be exploding in my brain, like an\nempty library suddenly being realized! Details flooded my being about\nmany wonderful and sacred things. I wondered: were these things newly\nlearned, or just somehow remembered? Everything somehow felt familiar,\nin the Oneness of it all.\n\nThe spirit who was speaking to me did not offer his name, and I did not\nask. I wanted to be careful to show homage only to the True God and\nChrist, not to any one else. I then felt myself sinking, as if falling\nthrough a bed. I was being pulled back.\n\nWith that, I woke up, my husband shaking me by the shoulders. Somehow my\nphysical body was now lying on the front seat of the truck, although I\nhad left it outside in the mud. Since I had left the house to go to the\ntractor shed, three hours had passed. The storm had gone, but left\nevidence that at least three other strikes had occurred on the pasture,\nbesides the one that had struck me.\n\n##  "Welcome to the World of Healers" \n\nAt the emergency room I was hooked up with wires and given tests to\ncheck my heart. A thorough exam revealed that it had not been damaged.\nBut, my eyes and ears were affected very badly, as was my sense of\nbalance. I felt dizzy, but keenly aware of the reality of my experience.\nThe only piece of jewelry I was wearing was a single diamond earring. A\nbrown burn mark encircled the gold stud where it went through my ear. My\nskin tingled all over and was extremely sensitive to the touch,\nespecially on my arms and in my hands.\n\nThe doctors told me that I had been very lucky; the doctor said that\noften an arm or leg gets blown off during a strike (was he kidding?).\nPeople often die (and don't come back yes, I knew that). They reasoned\nthat because I was holding the chain-link with one hand and the wet\nwooden pole with the other, the current had passed through me, instead\nof grounding in my body. I knew they wouldn't believe me if I told them\nit had been a Divine Strike, that God used this as a wake-up call, and\nthat I had been before the Presence of God ( and oh, by the way, Jesus\nspoke to me!). They would have kept me a lot longer than they did, and\nprobably in a little white jacket, in a locked padded room to boot!\n\nI spent a few days in bed, oscillating between a wild mixture of extreme\nhappiness and unbelievable sadness. The emotions ran deeper than any I\nhad ever felt. I was glad for the experience, but I had wanted to stay\nthere! I kept re-living the event over and over in my mind, every detail\nemblazoned into my brain. I was determined that even if I forgot my own\nname, I would never forget this. I tried painting what I had seen - oil\npaints on canvas. The colors, no matter how I mixed them, were not\nbrilliant enough. Nothing could capture what I had seen and felt. I felt\nsad again. Then once more, happy for the experience. Then confused. What\ndid it all mean?\n\n##  My First Healing Experience a Horse! \n\nAfter a few days, I was back to my chores, including putting salve on\nStar's skin infection. For six weeks I had smoothed on the medicine the\nvet had given me, but still the red blisters kept spreading and killing\nthe hair all around his girth. Now I had run out of medicine, so I just\nrubbed his belly lightly around the outside of the infection because he\nhad grown used to the attention. I noticed that my hands were getting\nvery hot. I thought it must be bacteria from the infection, and when I\nwashed my hands under cold water it went away. I didn't think anything\nof it.\n\nThe next day, I walked up to rub his belly again - reminding myself to\nget new salve soon - and noticed that all the blisters had turned white\nand some were falling off. I once more rubbed around the infection, and\nmy hands turned hot once more. The next day when I went out, all the\nblisters had fallen off, and there was evidence of new hair growing\nback. I thought this was mere coincidence.\n\nThe next week, I took my cat in to be spayed. The vet said it would take\n10 days for the stitches to completely heal. On the first day, she\ndidn't want anything to do with me. But, the second day, she was in my\nlap as much as possible. She just would not leave me alone - even\nyowling for me if I left the room! Every time I would rub her and pet\nher, I found that my hands would heat up again. On the third day, she\ntried pulling the stitches out with her teeth. On the morning of the\nfourth day, I decided to look at what was going on, and found that the\nskin had healed so well that the stitches were puckering her skin up\ntight. I found myself embarrassed to take her back to the vet - what\nwould he say? So I carefully cut the threads and pulled them out myself,\nthrough skin that bore no surgical scar. I began to understand what was\nhappening.\n\nThen, I wondered, will this work on humans? The very next day, I said a\nprayer to God, laid my hands hot on my forehead, and on various parts of\nmy body. Then, I made an appointment with the doctor. A previous\nmammogram had shown lumps in my breasts. A former doctor had told me I\nhad fibroid cysts in my uterus, which could only be removed through\nsurgery. Also, I had a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder, which had\nprevented me from sleeping well for the past six months.\n\nI anxiously awaited the test results: the mammogram showed the lumps\nwere all gone. the diagnostic ultrasound showed clear, the fibroid cysts\nhad disappeared. also, I could sleep at night without any pain; my\nrotator cuff was healed.\n\n##  God had blessed me with the gift of healing! This is what he had meant! \n\nHesitantly, I started sharing this new gift with my friends - and\nthat's when I ran into trouble. I found that I was taking the pain of\ntheir ailment onto myself. If they had a migraine, I would get a\nmigraine. If they had stomach pain, I would get stomach pain. That\nscared me - I found myself afraid to use the gift. Maybe I was using it\nwrong? Why would God give me a gift that would harm me to use it? I felt\nI wouldn't last very long in this work. And yet, I knew in my heart\nthat God wouldn't give me something that would be unsafe for me to use.\nWhat was I missing?\n\nI thought I might find answers if I watched the healing ministries on\nTV. For the first time in my life I wondered if they could actually be\nlegitimate. I had never believed in this sort of thing - I had felt it\nwas a fake, showy display to raise money and give people false hope. Now\nI wanted desperately to talk to one of them. Did they feel sick\nafterward? Had they each been told, "Welcome to the world of healers?"\nin some way? Was I part of this same group? What did God want me to\nunderstand?\n\nI continued on this way for a time, confused by the gift. I thought\nmaybe I would work only on animals; I did not feel their pain. I\nimagined myself working for a veterinarian, alone in a back room,\nquietly healing the animals. I didn't know what to do.\n\nSo, I prayed for understanding, and what I found was the Lord's words\noverflowing back at me. On and on the scriptures popped out of the\nBible, the pages randomly falling open to pertinent information, my eyes\nemblazoned on the scriptures he wanted me to see. They popped out as\nbrightly as if a yellow marker pen highlighted them! Dozens of\nscriptures!\n\n"For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to\nprosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."\n(Jer. 29:11)\n\n"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.\nNeither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put\nit on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the\nsame way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good\ndeeds and praise your Father in heaven." (Mt. 5:14)\n\n"...fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying\non of my hands. For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a\nspirit of power, of love and of self-discipline." (2 Tim. 1:6)\n\nThrough his Word he kept reminding me that when the Lord gives his\npeople a commission or Divine gift, he does not do it without a specific\npurpose. So many times I had been absolutely shattered, yet he had still\nheld me gently in the palm of his hands. There had also been many times\nwe had walked together hand-in-hand, and many times I had turned away\nfrom him, hid my face in shame, and withdrew my hand from his. Yet, his\narm was still outstretched, and he still loved meI was astonished.\nEverything I had done and He Still Loved Me! Unbelievable! And now, he\ngave me a real purpose, along with a job where I would be working in\ndirect communion with him everyday. He wasn't tired of me yet! I would\nalso be making friends and helping people from all walks of life, social\nstanding, color and religious background. I would get to be there when\nhe went to work. I would get to see the miracles as he reached out to\ntell his children he is real and cares about them, manifesting reality\nout of the invisible.\n\nSo why the lightning strike and near-death experience? I truly feel he\nhad gone through all this trouble to let me know my life's path. I had\nbeen so stubborn and resistant, having "blinders" on and putting "God\nin a box," that only an empirical, first-hand experience would open me\nup to my true created nature. I had a purpose now, and I did not have to\nsuffer in silence or ignore my plight. I could be strong again, because\nhis strength was in me. Everything was made anew! By Free Will I had\ndied to self at the foot of heaven and upon the earth - and he had\nresurrected me up again. I was a new person. He opened me up! I vowed I\nwould never allow myself to be closed down again!\n\nI asked to be as giving as the wind, that I would go wherever he led me.\n"The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot\ntell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone\nborn of the Spirit." (John 3:8)\n\n##  Reiki Healing in the God-Spot \n\nOne day, a trusted friend invited me to a Reiki ("ray'key") Open\nHouse near my home in Nashville, Tennessee. She said there were other\npeople with the gift there, and people were being healed. I cautiously\nwent with her. I found people praying and laughing, and the laying-on-of\nhands. Their hands were hot like mine; and the people they were\nattending had come from the community, mostly the poor and the curious.\nTwice a month they would gather here in this upper room and invite any\nwho wanted to come. I watched them, and it made me wonder. I felt\ncomforted that there was a large painting of Jesus hanging predominately\non the wall. On the desk was information about this Japanese technique,\nand I thumbed through it. There was a picture of a man, a Christian\nminister, Dr. Usui, who had given Japanese hands-on-healing this name of\nReiki in the early 1800's, although it had been known for hundreds of\nyears before. He had started many healing clinics in Japan. I looked at\nthe picture and gasped - I knew this man!\n\nThis was the spirit with slant-eyes and rounded belly that was beside me\nduring my near-death experience! The very same man! My Goodness! God\nworks in very, very mysterious ways!\n\nWith this, I knew what my next step was; and I went through the training\nclasses of Usui Reiki, eventually receiving what is called the Reiki\nMaster Degree. The pain I had been feeling was gone. Now, I felt\nenergized and euphoric after the healings! I was not taking upon myself\nthe other person's pain anymore. I believe the pain was merely a\ncatalyst to keep seeking answers, and to lead me to my next step. So,\nnow I was using the "Gifts of the Spirit" offering "Healing Prayer"\nand "Divine Healing" under the title of "Reiki Practitioner." But\nwhy had God led me up this path, one that I had never heard of before?\nWhy was this strange name added to the calling of my mission?\n\nI have given much thought and prayer to this question. And this is what\nI have been given as the answer. And since he continues to use this\nvessel for even more powerful works, I know his blessing has been upon\nit. I have learned not to judge where his Spirit places my foot, that\nwherever I am he places an angel to protect and shield me with a flaming\nsword of Unconditional Love.\n\nReiki is recognized by the American Medical Association as a\nComplementary Alternative Medicine. It is used in many hospitals by\ntrained nurses and doctors as a complement to normal health care needs.\nIt has consistent and measurable results. There are more and more\nstudies (including double-blind studies by NIH) and more research is\nbeing conducted. This form of hands-on-healing is easily accessible, and\nmore and more accepted by the public. In this way, I have an opportunity\nto work with people of all religions and faiths, and people without\nfaith, and God still touches them with an empirical experience. Not all\nReiki practitioners use prayer with their healings, though; so the kind\nof healing that I am facilitated for is could be more accurately\ndescribed as "Divine Healing," which is hands-on-healing combined with\nhealing prayer. Adding prayer and recognizing Source is what makes the\nmiracles happen.\n\nI have found that a person does not need to be struck by lightning or\nhave a NDE to have healing hands. There are many people who are drawn to\nbecome healers; and by asking, The Big Guy often gives this opportunity\nto them as a free gift, and tests them out with it to see how they\nrespond to it. Doors will open, or close, from there. Are they working\nfor ego, or giving the credit to the One True Healer?\n\nNow, my entire life is an adventure and an aware spirit journey! I get\nto see cancer disappear, brain tumors shrink and go away, blind eyes see\nand deaf ears hear. I get to be there when the arthritis melts away and\nchronic disease abates. I get to be there to see the addictions leave\nwithout side-effects, and I get to help bring peace, calmness and\npainlessness to those transitioning in death. I meet people from all\nover the world, and get to be there everyday when incredible things\nhappen, and form friendships that are deep and loving. Along the way,\nthis wider connection with God has led to other interventions of Spirit,\nsuch as miraculous long-distance healings, medical intuitiveness,\nlocating missing children, visions and prophecies, and even helping the\nFBI on 9-11. Through this Oneness Connection, nothing is impossible! I\npraise God continually as I enjoy every day, every moment, and every\nexperience I have! I am always amazed how he brings his kids together,\nto learn to love one another and help each other. It totally humbles me\nto be involved in this kind of work.\n\nThe point that I want you to remember from my experience is this: you\ndon't have to be struck by lightning or have a near-death experience to\nopen up, change your life, appreciate each other, or to have a special\nconnection with God. Love is the key to everything. Remember, the\nlife-review you have will be about the love you showed, or didn't show!\nIt's all about love!\n\n"But I tell you that men will have to give account on the Day of\nJudgment for every careless word they have spoken. For by your words you\nwill be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned." (Mt.\n12:36,37)\n\nWhen I was before the Ultimate, I wished only to love and be responsible\nto him. But what he wanted was for me to be responsible and love\neveryone else. So, we prove our love by loving everybody else!\n\nMy brokenness led me to a mending of the very highest kind, and\neverything in my life has changed, in alignment to fulfilling that\npurpose. I feel blissful now, every night and every day, knowing I am\ndoing exactly what I should be doing. I am blessed to be working in\nseveral locations in southern California as a full-time healer, and\nbeing flown around the world for healings and conventions. Even when I\ndidn't know what to ask for, in my most broken of times, The Big Guy\ngave me my life's work. And I am happier that I have ever been before!\nWhatever periods of brokenness in my life I had to go through, whatever\nlessons I needed to learn to get to this place in my spiritual journey,\nI can release and be glad for! Now, I am making a better "movie" for\nwhen I come before the Presence again, and I'm sharing the gifts our\nFather freely gives us. I am thankful everyday that when I was stubborn\nand striking out, He stepped in and struck me down! Truly, the best\nthing that happened in my life was almost losing it. Being dead healed\nmy life; and now it heals others.\n\n<i> Tiffany Snow, D.D., M.Th. is the author of two books and many\narticles, and has appeared on radio and TV, including a TV documentary\non NDEs.

You are always the one getting\ninto trouble! In the middle of a storm trying to find fresh grass!&rdquo; As\nI let the chain of the tractor shed down with one hand, I steadied\nmyself against a wooden structure pole with the other. The horse bolted\nup the pasture, as the finger of God bolted down. That stormy day on my\nhorse ranch in Tennessee, standing in the pouring rain with my arms\noutstretched, I was struck dead by a bolt of lightning </i></p>\n\n<p>Not everyone needs to be struck by lightning, or have a miracle happen,\nto understand God&#39;s will for his life. But, that is the method that God\nused to fix up one of his most broken kids: me.</p>\n\n<p>It was summertime in the South. A time of good green pasture for the\nhorses, ripe tomatoes on the vine, and long drives in the country. Life\nseemed wonderfully slow for me that gracious summer; as slow as the\ndrone of the honeybees in the apple trees, as slow as the preparations\nfor the upcoming county fair.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time in many years, all four of my children had come\ntogether for vacation time, and I knew that it would probably be the\nlast tick of the clock before their lives would get too busy to\nexperience this again. I was making every opportunity to show them a\nfull and adventurous summer. Life had never been so materially good! I\nwas thankful to share the riches of my new life as a new wife. We would\nswim in the pool, watch movies and ride the go-cart. We would drive the\njaguar in the country and go camping and have picnics. We would ride the\nhorses.</p>\n\n<p>I could overlook the growing detachment of my husband and the late night\nphone calls. I could also ignore the mysterious apathy and disdain my\noldest daughter had for me. I could overlook the bill collectors&#39;\nconstant threats and the new expensive toys being brought home that we\ncouldn&#39;t afford. I thought I could make it through anything - hadn&#39;t I\njust survived my fourth encounter with possible death? Even the doctors\nwere amazed. The venomous spider bite had tried to shut down my\nbreathing and my heart, but the doctors knew what drugs to pump through\nme and I had made it through - and this had happened just the previous\nweek!</p>\n\n<p>My husband and I had been married only a year and a half. The marriage\ncounseling would work. He would stop comparing me unfavorably to his\n&ldquo;special friend&rdquo; of seventeen years, telling me about her just two\nweeks ago; and for me to &ldquo;just deal with it.&rdquo; He would stop needing\nher. He would remember he loved only me. I hoped time would blow away\nthe ominous gray clouds gathering in my personal life. I kept telling\nmyself time would help, and I would adjust again, somehow.</p>\n\n<p>I hoped that if I closed my eyes and wished hard enough, everything bad\nwould just disappear. Hadn&#39;t I gone through this enough times? Why did\nthis keep repeating itself? Why did I continue to make bad choices about\nthe mate in my life? One thing I had learned - that I would feel that I\ndidn&#39;t deserve this and that God had abandoned me. Then I would usually\ntry to fix things myself. When I would fail, I would then call upon Him,\nand he would bail me out, change the situation, and slowly mend all the\nbroken parts. But this time, I felt there was no way my life could be\nfixed. I was broken beyond repair. I felt I had no mission, that my life\nhad no purpose.</p>\n\n<p>I was so tired of starting over. For the first time in my life I felt I\nhad some material advantage, and I did not want that to change - the\nchildren enjoyed it so much, and so did I. I chose not to pray about it\n- I felt I would sacrifice my happiness for the material gain of the\nchildren and I. I had messed up my life too much, too many times. There\nwas nothing left for me. I decided I would do what my husband said, and\njust &ldquo;deal with it.&rdquo; I would resign myself to ignoring the problems\naround me, and just struggle from day to day, with a fake smile and\nheavy heart. Love between people seemed only a faade for control. I felt\nalready dead; my heart knew no joy. I was without hope, and felt\nhelplessly broken.</p>\n\n<p>Although I refused to see the storm swirling under my own roof, I\ncouldn&#39;t ignore the rain and thunderclouds gathering outside over the\nvalley. Strong winds were blowing up the hill over the pasture. The rain\nwas pelting the garden and sounded like marbles dropping on the\nmetal-roofed sheds. I had to go check on the horses. I had to make sure\nthey were safe. That&#39;s when I ran out of time. And I would never look\nat time, and many other things, the same way again. My old life would\nsoon be over; the former anxiety ridden, hopeless person I was,\nliterally died on that summer day</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I remember about the strike itself was doing an\nuncontrollable electrical &ldquo;dance&rdquo; as my muscles contorted this way and\nthat reminiscent of the wild gyrations of John Travolta in Saturday\nNight Fever! I felt no pain. In that split second, I turned around and\ntried to push my chest against the corner of the parked truck, knowing\nthat electrical shocks often stop the heart. Then, my eyesight narrowed\nand I felt my body slowly slide down the bumper onto the wet earth; and\nall went black</p>\n\n<p>The next thing I knew, I found myself standing on nothing, way up in the\nuniverse, and there were distant colorful planets all around me. I could\nsee misty pinpoints of stars through my right arm, and when I moved it\nback and forth it made the stars look wiggly, like a reflection on\nwater. I felt dizzy. I had a sense of being able to see not only in\nfront of me, but all around me at the same time. Floating just a few\nfeet from me, I saw a man with a spirit body just like mine (no wings),\nthough he was short and had slanted eyes. He spoke to me with a voice\nthat I heard inside my own head, saying: &ldquo;Don&#39;t be afraid, it&#39;s ok.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>On the other side of me, another spirit person, this one much taller and\nwith chiseled facial features (again no wings), nodded approvingly at\nme. All the while, we were moving with great speed toward a great\nellipsed ball of spinning light; it was brilliantly white in the middle\nand yellowish on the outside edges. The closer we got to it, the more I\nfelt overwhelming Love; it seemed so warm and comforting, it encompassed\nmy very beinglike the security of a favorite grandfather&#39;s broad arms\nwrapped around a child as he crawls up onto his lap. How wonderful I\nfelt!</p>\n\n<p>We stopped. The bright light was still far from me. I wanted to go on, I\nfelt like a magnet, irresistibly drawn. The desire to &ldquo;blend&rdquo; had\ngrown stronger the closer we got I knew this place was the heavenly\nthrone of God himself!</p>\n\n<p>Why had we stopped? As I stood there confused, yearning toward the Great\nAlmighty beyond my reach, a glowing luminousness appeared in front of\nme. Gold and white sparkles came together in a glowing spiritual body, a\ngiant image in the shape of a man with broad shoulders. A Divine\nPresence was here!</p>\n\n<p>A gentle voice called out from this realm of golden sparkles massed\nbrilliantly in front of me &ldquo;What Have You Learned?&rdquo; he asked, in a\nnondiscriminatory and non-accusing way. The voice was so soft and\ntender, yet the presence of Divine Authority was there; I knew that it\nwas the voice of God&#39;s own son, the empowered Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n<p>Then - all of a sudden, life events unfolded before my very eyes! Key\nmoments where I showed anger to people, and also where I had showed\nlove, appeared like scenes out of a movie! I could feel the anger and\nhurt of the other person whenever I had been mean; and I also felt the\nanger as it rippled on through to others. I had never before faced the\nhorrid deepness of my own sin. Then, where I showed love to people, I\nfelt that too; and how much further that rippled out from person to\nperson, as a warm pulse triggering cause and effect in all things that\nwere wonderful and blessedI had never before experienced such joy!</p>\n\n<p>Then the presence of Christ said, &ldquo;The Flesh is the Test of the\nSpiritLove Each Other.&rdquo; Words of wisdom imparted to me! I felt\noverwhelmed with love, and so privileged.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to stay! I wanted to join myself with God&#39;s swirling life\nforce, His Essence, His Heaven, was just beyond the presence of Jesus!\nBut, I wasn&#39;t allowed to go any further. I wanted to go to God! I\nwanted to feel more Love! &ldquo;Why can&#39;t I be with you now Father? Please,\nGod, Please!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I listened as hard as I could listen, waiting for His Words. Then, just\non the outside of my understanding, I faintly heard voices singing the\nmost beautiful melody I had ever heard in my whole life. I knew that\nthese were the blessed voices of angels and those joined with God, and\ncame from His Swirling Brilliant Presence, Heaven.</p>\n\n<p>I knew it was praise for The Father, but I just couldn&#39;t make out what\nthe words were saying. I felt so sadI knew I needed to go back to the\nearth. I knew I had to make a &ldquo;better movie.&rdquo; How I wanted to stay!\nBut, there was also a knowing that I did have a choice in this, although\nthe desire to prove my love for God was overwhelming. Yes, I wanted to\nstay. But, there and then, I vowed to be a vessel to do only His Will,\nif he could use me. I would go back.</p>\n\n<p>I absolutely gave myself to him. I wanted desperately to show how much I\nloved him! His Will, not my own, would govern the rest of my life. If he\ncould use this broken piece of clay from the earth, it was all his. I\ntotally dedicated myself and surrendered all desires. Instantly, I felt\na child-like sense of wonderment as a warm flood of bliss and peace\noverpowered me, and a warm tingling sensation filled me, like warm\nliquid honey flowing from the top of my head down to my very toes! What\nwas happening to me? I did not know. Only later did I find out that this\nis referred to as the baptism of the Holy Spirit, an anointing more\ncommonly experienced on earth. At that moment I knew that I would spend\nthe rest of my earthly life showing God how much I loved him, by helping\nhis children, whom he loved. They would be shown the true identity of a\nPowerful Loving God, desiring to be supernaturally active in their\nlives. I had a mission!</p>\n\n<p>The spirit on my right then talked inside my head again, and answered\nmany questions on my mind. He also taught me details about many\nwonderful and sacred things. Many of these things I am still trying to\nintegrate and fully understand. It is almost like trying to learn\nanother language without being given the basic alphabet for it. So, at\nthis point, there are deeper things I have told no one, and keep only to\nmyself. Often, when in prayer to the Father I will ask him to further my\nunderstanding on these matters, yet I get the distinct feeling that true\nunderstanding will be revealed only on a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis. There\nwas no need to occupy myself with them right now.</p>\n\n<p>However, for some reason a seed was planted within me; a groundwork had\nbeen laid. And I knew that if he wanted me to share this information\nlater on, he would tell me, and give me the reasoning ability to\nunderstand it. In fact, many things &ldquo;I didn&#39;t know I knew&rdquo; end up\nbeing in the pages of the books he asks me to write, and what a joy they\nhave turned out to be to love so many people in this way, and to be\nloved back!</p>\n\n<p>While I floated there before the Christ Consciousness, the very Presence\nof Jesus, the spirit then told me something that I didn&#39;t at all\nunderstand: &ldquo;Welcome to the world of healers,&rdquo; he said. This was a\nshock - I had no idea what that meant. I had never believed in such a\nthing! I had been ordained back in 1979 in a church that believed\nhealing had died out in the first century, and also that NDEs were\nchemical reactions released in the brain. What could this mean?</p>\n\n<p>At this point the Christ went back into formless sparkles and faded\naway, and the stars and space behind his glowing features were visible\nonce again. Such effervescent beauty and colors twinkled around me, like\nbeing in the midst of a sparkling aurora borealis! So many shapes of\nheavenly bodies transfixed in the cosmos, all unique and necessary, all\nuntold distances away. Yet they felt so close that it seemed I could\nreach out and pluck them out of the sky, and carry them home cupped in\nmy hands.</p>\n\n<p>The slant-eyed spirit went on and continued to teach me even more. He\npointed out different stars, planets, distant colorful swirling lights\nof all kinds, and gave names for all of them. He continued to fill me up\nand give me answers to thousands of questions that I never had questions\nfor! Reams of information seemed to be exploding in my brain, like an\nempty library suddenly being realized! Details flooded my being about\nmany wonderful and sacred things. I wondered: were these things newly\nlearned, or just somehow remembered? Everything somehow felt familiar,\nin the Oneness of it all.</p>\n\n<p>The spirit who was speaking to me did not offer his name, and I did not\nask. I wanted to be careful to show homage only to the True God and\nChrist, not to any one else. I then felt myself sinking, as if falling\nthrough a bed. I was being pulled back.</p>\n\n<p>With that, I woke up, my husband shaking me by the shoulders. Somehow my\nphysical body was now lying on the front seat of the truck, although I\nhad left it outside in the mud. Since I had left the house to go to the\ntractor shed, three hours had passed. The storm had gone, but left\nevidence that at least three other strikes had occurred on the pasture,\nbesides the one that had struck me.</p>\n\n<h2>&ldquo;Welcome to the World of Healers&rdquo;</h2>\n\n<p>At the emergency room I was hooked up with wires and given tests to\ncheck my heart. A thorough exam revealed that it had not been damaged.\nBut, my eyes and ears were affected very badly, as was my sense of\nbalance. I felt dizzy, but keenly aware of the reality of my experience.\nThe only piece of jewelry I was wearing was a single diamond earring. A\nbrown burn mark encircled the gold stud where it went through my ear. My\nskin tingled all over and was extremely sensitive to the touch,\nespecially on my arms and in my hands.</p>\n\n<p>The doctors told me that I had been very lucky; the doctor said that\noften an arm or leg gets blown off during a strike (was he kidding?).\nPeople often die (and don&#39;t come back yes, I knew that). They reasoned\nthat because I was holding the chain-link with one hand and the wet\nwooden pole with the other, the current had passed through me, instead\nof grounding in my body. I knew they wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told them\nit had been a Divine Strike, that God used this as a wake-up call, and\nthat I had been before the Presence of God ( and oh, by the way, Jesus\nspoke to me!). They would have kept me a lot longer than they did, and\nprobably in a little white jacket, in a locked padded room to boot!</p>\n\n<p>I spent a few days in bed, oscillating between a wild mixture of extreme\nhappiness and unbelievable sadness. The emotions ran deeper than any I\nhad ever felt. I was glad for the experience, but I had wanted to stay\nthere! I kept re-living the event over and over in my mind, every detail\nemblazoned into my brain. I was determined that even if I forgot my own\nname, I would never forget this. I tried painting what I had seen - oil\npaints on canvas. The colors, no matter how I mixed them, were not\nbrilliant enough. Nothing could capture what I had seen and felt. I felt\nsad again. Then once more, happy for the experience. Then confused. What\ndid it all mean?</p>\n\n<h2>My First Healing Experience a Horse!</h2>\n\n<p>After a few days, I was back to my chores, including putting salve on\nStar&#39;s skin infection. For six weeks I had smoothed on the medicine the\nvet had given me, but still the red blisters kept spreading and killing\nthe hair all around his girth. Now I had run out of medicine, so I just\nrubbed his belly lightly around the outside of the infection because he\nhad grown used to the attention. I noticed that my hands were getting\nvery hot. I thought it must be bacteria from the infection, and when I\nwashed my hands under cold water it went away. I didn&#39;t think anything\nof it.</p>\n\n<p>The next day, I walked up to rub his belly again - reminding myself to\nget new salve soon - and noticed that all the blisters had turned white\nand some were falling off. I once more rubbed around the infection, and\nmy hands turned hot once more. The next day when I went out, all the\nblisters had fallen off, and there was evidence of new hair growing\nback. I thought this was mere coincidence.</p>\n\n<p>The next week, I took my cat in to be spayed. The vet said it would take\n10 days for the stitches to completely heal. On the first day, she\ndidn&#39;t want anything to do with me. But, the second day, she was in my\nlap as much as possible. She just would not leave me alone - even\nyowling for me if I left the room! Every time I would rub her and pet\nher, I found that my hands would heat up again. On the third day, she\ntried pulling the stitches out with her teeth. On the morning of the\nfourth day, I decided to look at what was going on, and found that the\nskin had healed so well that the stitches were puckering her skin up\ntight. I found myself embarrassed to take her back to the vet - what\nwould he say? So I carefully cut the threads and pulled them out myself,\nthrough skin that bore no surgical scar. I began to understand what was\nhappening.</p>\n\n<p>Then, I wondered, will this work on humans? The very next day, I said a\nprayer to God, laid my hands hot on my forehead, and on various parts of\nmy body. Then, I made an appointment with the doctor. A previous\nmammogram had shown lumps in my breasts. A former doctor had told me I\nhad fibroid cysts in my uterus, which could only be removed through\nsurgery. Also, I had a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder, which had\nprevented me from sleeping well for the past six months.</p>\n\n<p>I anxiously awaited the test results: the mammogram showed the lumps\nwere all gone. the diagnostic ultrasound showed clear, the fibroid cysts\nhad disappeared. also, I could sleep at night without any pain; my\nrotator cuff was healed.</p>\n\n<h2>God had blessed me with the gift of healing! This is what he had meant!</h2>\n\n<p>Hesitantly, I started sharing this new gift with my friends - and\nthat&#39;s when I ran into trouble. I found that I was taking the pain of\ntheir ailment onto myself. If they had a migraine, I would get a\nmigraine. If they had stomach pain, I would get stomach pain. That\nscared me - I found myself afraid to use the gift. Maybe I was using it\nwrong? Why would God give me a gift that would harm me to use it? I felt\nI wouldn&#39;t last very long in this work. And yet, I knew in my heart\nthat God wouldn&#39;t give me something that would be unsafe for me to use.\nWhat was I missing?</p>\n\n<p>I thought I might find answers if I watched the healing ministries on\nTV. For the first time in my life I wondered if they could actually be\nlegitimate. I had never believed in this sort of thing - I had felt it\nwas a fake, showy display to raise money and give people false hope. Now\nI wanted desperately to talk to one of them. Did they feel sick\nafterward? Had they each been told, &ldquo;Welcome to the world of healers?&rdquo;\nin some way? Was I part of this same group? What did God want me to\nunderstand?</p>\n\n<p>I continued on this way for a time, confused by the gift. I thought\nmaybe I would work only on animals; I did not feel their pain. I\nimagined myself working for a veterinarian, alone in a back room,\nquietly healing the animals. I didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>\n\n<p>So, I prayed for understanding, and what I found was the Lord&#39;s words\noverflowing back at me. On and on the scriptures popped out of the\nBible, the pages randomly falling open to pertinent information, my eyes\nemblazoned on the scriptures he wanted me to see. They popped out as\nbrightly as if a yellow marker pen highlighted them! Dozens of\nscriptures!</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For I know the plans I have for you,&rdquo; declares the Lord, &ldquo;plans to\nprosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.&rdquo;\n(Jer. 29:11)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.\nNeither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put\nit on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the\nsame way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good\ndeeds and praise your Father in heaven.&rdquo; (Mt. 5:14)</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;&hellip;fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying\non of my hands. For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a\nspirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:6)</p>\n\n<p>Through his Word he kept reminding me that when the Lord gives his\npeople a commission or Divine gift, he does not do it without a specific\npurpose. So many times I had been absolutely shattered, yet he had still\nheld me gently in the palm of his hands. There had also been many times\nwe had walked together hand-in-hand, and many times I had turned away\nfrom him, hid my face in shame, and withdrew my hand from his. Yet, his\narm was still outstretched, and he still loved meI was astonished.\nEverything I had done and He Still Loved Me! Unbelievable! And now, he\ngave me a real purpose, along with a job where I would be working in\ndirect communion with him everyday. He wasn&#39;t tired of me yet! I would\nalso be making friends and helping people from all walks of life, social\nstanding, color and religious background. I would get to be there when\nhe went to work. I would get to see the miracles as he reached out to\ntell his children he is real and cares about them, manifesting reality\nout of the invisible.</p>\n\n<p>So why the lightning strike and near-death experience? I truly feel he\nhad gone through all this trouble to let me know my life&#39;s path. I had\nbeen so stubborn and resistant, having &ldquo;blinders&rdquo; on and putting &ldquo;God\nin a box,&rdquo; that only an empirical, first-hand experience would open me\nup to my true created nature. I had a purpose now, and I did not have to\nsuffer in silence or ignore my plight. I could be strong again, because\nhis strength was in me. Everything was made anew! By Free Will I had\ndied to self at the foot of heaven and upon the earth - and he had\nresurrected me up again. I was a new person. He opened me up! I vowed I\nwould never allow myself to be closed down again!</p>\n\n<p>I asked to be as giving as the wind, that I would go wherever he led me.\n&ldquo;The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot\ntell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone\nborn of the Spirit.&rdquo; (John 3:8)</p>\n\n<h2>Reiki Healing in the God-Spot</h2>\n\n<p>One day, a trusted friend invited me to a Reiki (&ldquo;ray&#39;key&rdquo;) Open\nHouse near my home in Nashville, Tennessee. She said there were other\npeople with the gift there, and people were being healed. I cautiously\nwent with her. I found people praying and laughing, and the laying-on-of\nhands. Their hands were hot like mine; and the people they were\nattending had come from the community, mostly the poor and the curious.\nTwice a month they would gather here in this upper room and invite any\nwho wanted to come. I watched them, and it made me wonder. I felt\ncomforted that there was a large painting of Jesus hanging predominately\non the wall. On the desk was information about this Japanese technique,\nand I thumbed through it. There was a picture of a man, a Christian\nminister, Dr. Usui, who had given Japanese hands-on-healing this name of\nReiki in the early 1800&#39;s, although it had been known for hundreds of\nyears before. He had started many healing clinics in Japan. I looked at\nthe picture and gasped - I knew this man!</p>\n\n<p>This was the spirit with slant-eyes and rounded belly that was beside me\nduring my near-death experience! The very same man! My Goodness! God\nworks in very, very mysterious ways!</p>\n\n<p>With this, I knew what my next step was; and I went through the training\nclasses of Usui Reiki, eventually receiving what is called the Reiki\nMaster Degree. The pain I had been feeling was gone. Now, I felt\nenergized and euphoric after the healings! I was not taking upon myself\nthe other person&#39;s pain anymore. I believe the pain was merely a\ncatalyst to keep seeking answers, and to lead me to my next step. So,\nnow I was using the &ldquo;Gifts of the Spirit&rdquo; offering &ldquo;Healing Prayer&rdquo;\nand &ldquo;Divine Healing&rdquo; under the title of &ldquo;Reiki Practitioner.&rdquo; But\nwhy had God led me up this path, one that I had never heard of before?\nWhy was this strange name added to the calling of my mission?</p>\n\n<p>I have given much thought and prayer to this question. And this is what\nI have been given as the answer. And since he continues to use this\nvessel for even more powerful works, I know his blessing has been upon\nit. I have learned not to judge where his Spirit places my foot, that\nwherever I am he places an angel to protect and shield me with a flaming\nsword of Unconditional Love.</p>\n\n<p>Reiki is recognized by the American Medical Association as a\nComplementary Alternative Medicine. It is used in many hospitals by\ntrained nurses and doctors as a complement to normal health care needs.\nIt has consistent and measurable results. There are more and more\nstudies (including double-blind studies by NIH) and more research is\nbeing conducted. This form of hands-on-healing is easily accessible, and\nmore and more accepted by the public. In this way, I have an opportunity\nto work with people of all religions and faiths, and people without\nfaith, and God still touches them with an empirical experience. Not all\nReiki practitioners use prayer with their healings, though; so the kind\nof healing that I am facilitated for is could be more accurately\ndescribed as &ldquo;Divine Healing,&rdquo; which is hands-on-healing combined with\nhealing prayer. Adding prayer and recognizing Source is what makes the\nmiracles happen.</p>\n\n<p>I have found that a person does not need to be struck by lightning or\nhave a NDE to have healing hands. There are many people who are drawn to\nbecome healers; and by asking, The Big Guy often gives this opportunity\nto them as a free gift, and tests them out with it to see how they\nrespond to it. Doors will open, or close, from there. Are they working\nfor ego, or giving the credit to the One True Healer?</p>\n\n<p>Now, my entire life is an adventure and an aware spirit journey! I get\nto see cancer disappear, brain tumors shrink and go away, blind eyes see\nand deaf ears hear. I get to be there when the arthritis melts away and\nchronic disease abates. I get to be there to see the addictions leave\nwithout side-effects, and I get to help bring peace, calmness and\npainlessness to those transitioning in death. I meet people from all\nover the world, and get to be there everyday when incredible things\nhappen, and form friendships that are deep and loving. Along the way,\nthis wider connection with God has led to other interventions of Spirit,\nsuch as miraculous long-distance healings, medical intuitiveness,\nlocating missing children, visions and prophecies, and even helping the\nFBI on 9-11. Through this Oneness Connection, nothing is impossible! I\npraise God continually as I enjoy every day, every moment, and every\nexperience I have! I am always amazed how he brings his kids together,\nto learn to love one another and help each other. It totally humbles me\nto be involved in this kind of work.</p>\n\n<p>The point that I want you to remember from my experience is this: you\ndon&#39;t have to be struck by lightning or have a near-death experience to\nopen up, change your life, appreciate each other, or to have a special\nconnection with God. Love is the key to everything. Remember, the\nlife-review you have will be about the love you showed, or didn&#39;t show!\nIt&#39;s all about love!</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;But I tell you that men will have to give account on the Day of\nJudgment for every careless word they have spoken. For by your words you\nwill be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.&rdquo; (Mt.\n12:36,37)</p>\n\n<p>When I was before the Ultimate, I wished only to love and be responsible\nto him. But what he wanted was for me to be responsible and love\neveryone else. So, we prove our love by loving everybody else!</p>\n\n<p>My brokenness led me to a mending of the very highest kind, and\neverything in my life has changed, in alignment to fulfilling that\npurpose. I feel blissful now, every night and every day, knowing I am\ndoing exactly what I should be doing. I am blessed to be working in\nseveral locations in southern California as a full-time healer, and\nbeing flown around the world for healings and conventions. Even when I\ndidn&#39;t know what to ask for, in my most broken of times, The Big Guy\ngave me my life&#39;s work. And I am happier that I have ever been before!\nWhatever periods of brokenness in my life I had to go through, whatever\nlessons I needed to learn to get to this place in my spiritual journey,\nI can release and be glad for! Now, I am making a better &ldquo;movie&rdquo; for\nwhen I come before the Presence again, and I&#39;m sharing the gifts our\nFather freely gives us. I am thankful everyday that when I was stubborn\nand striking out, He stepped in and struck me down! Truly, the best\nthing that happened in my life was almost losing it. Being dead healed\nmy life; and now it heals others.</p>\n\n<p><i> Tiffany Snow, D.D., M.Th. is the author of two books and many\narticles, and has appeared on radio and TV, including a TV documentary\non NDEs.

13	Into the Light	Kesha L. Engel	In February, 1974, when I was fourteen years old, I experienced some\r\nkind of overdose which nearly killed me. I had willingly and recklessly\r\nsmoked something called "angel dust." Quite a rebel at that time of\r\nlife, I was expelled from the public school system---too many truancies\r\nand disruptive behavior. I also was recently arrested for drug use by\r\nundercover cops at the new school.\r\n\r\nThe night of the overdose I entered my room and closed the door to the\r\noutside world. I drifted into a deep, faraway sleep. The voices from\r\nother parts of the house faded into the distance. My body lay listless\r\non the bed and I suddenly was some place outside of myself---beyond the\r\nstorm, the suburbs and the city lights.\r\n\r\nI was traveling, tumbling through the darkness into a strange void of\r\nunfamiliar space. Sharp, stabbing nameless voices, without form, seemed\r\nto chase me in the blackness. Loud, buzzing, irritating and incessant\r\ntaunting seemed to pursue me. It was as if I was spinning, but I had no\r\nbody. I felt confused, frightened and utterly alone.\r\n\r\nAs I reached the peak of my despair, a new thought pierced my awareness.\r\nA dim and promising glow appeared in the farthest reaches of space.\r\nIntuitively, I knew that the light would save me from this torment. It\r\nseemed to magnetize me like a beacon in a sea of darkness and I knew I\r\nhad to direct myself to it.\r\n\r\nThe brilliance grew stronger and more alluring as my desire to be near\r\nit surged. And in an instatn, I was completely and profoundly surrounded\r\nby the brightest, most intense and loving light imaginable. It welcomed\r\nme with a sense of peace that I had never known before. I was awestruck.\r\nBut I was thinking, "How did I get here? Do I really deserve this?"\r\n\r\nWith that thought, I felt myself slide off the beam, as if all my\r\nprotection vanished. The forces of darkness were just too great. I heard\r\nthat haunting, malicious laughter again and it drew me down into an\r\nabyss. I wondered how I could retrieve the peace. What had I done wrong?\r\nWas it real? In a flash, I traversed the universe and felt enveloped in\r\nserenity once again. This time it was as if I could see without eyes. I\r\nperceived an ethereal mist and a lush, life-filled place awaited me. My\r\nenergy merged with that of a golden-white glowing essence---one of\r\ncomplete love and absolute safety. Filled with bliss, I knew I was going\r\nhome at last.\r\n\r\nYet before I could cross the threshold into my true home, I also knew\r\nthat I must return. Something unspoken filled my awareness and in\r\nseconds (as if time can be measured at these levels), I was being drawn\r\nbackwards. I perceived flashes of light swirling quickly by. They were\r\nlike tiny electrodes of information that contained scenes from my life.\r\nA vacuum-like suction swooped me directly from that safe haven and I\r\nwoke to my father's face bent over me.\r\n\r\nHe was shaking me violently, saying, "Get up! Get up now!" They had\r\nbeen calling me for half an hour and I hadn't moved. "If you don't\r\nget up now, we will call the hospital and your parole officer will know\r\nthat you have been using!"\r\n\r\nI felt as if I had been shot back to some kind of hell, disconnected\r\nfrom the light. My dad's nostrils flared with the smoky haze of his\r\ncigarette. He paced adamantly, "Get up," he commanded, when he saw my\r\neyes open. Somehow I was sentenced to live with this family and it felt\r\nso foreign to me. Oh, what a task it was to move. My body felt paralyzed\r\ninitially, as if it were filled with lead.\r\n\r\nAs disconcerting as it was to return to this world, I knew what I had to\r\ndo. I dragged my sandbagged legs across the floor and reached up to tear\r\na pot leaf poster off the bedroom wall. My dad stood incredulous. His\r\nmouth dropped open in disbelief, his eyes widened. "Do you want me to\r\nget rid of this?" he asked. I nodded and proceeded to rip down another\r\nblack light poster of Uncle Sam giving the finger. My dad just shook his\r\nhead and muttered, "Unbelievable."\r\n\r\nI could feel his heart lifting as my body grew lighter with every\r\nmovement. I turned more lights on and proceeded to clear my room of\r\nclutter, surrendering all the paraphernalia I had stashed. I stopped\r\nusing drugs that night.\r\n\r\nWith the support of some wonderful teachers, I became an honor roll\r\nstudent, and learned to meditate while still in high school. I was\r\nintroduced to the works of Dr. Elisabeth Kubler Ross and Dr. Raymond\r\nMoody, pioneers in the NDE movement. It helped put things in a new\r\ncontext for me. I am grateful for the inner experience and the\r\ncontinuing opportunity to explore this multidimensional world.\r\n\r\n<tt> Kesha L.

Something unspoken filled my awareness and in\nseconds (as if time can be measured at these levels), I was being drawn\nbackwards. I perceived flashes of light swirling quickly by. They were\nlike tiny electrodes of information that contained scenes from my life.\nA vacuum-like suction swooped me directly from that safe haven and I\nwoke to my father&rsquo;s face bent over me.</p>\n\n<p>He was shaking me violently, saying, &ldquo;Get up! Get up now!&rdquo; They had\nbeen calling me for half an hour and I hadn&rsquo;t moved. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t\nget up now, we will call the hospital and your parole officer will know\nthat you have been using!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I felt as if I had been shot back to some kind of hell, disconnected\nfrom the light. My dad&rsquo;s nostrils flared with the smoky haze of his\ncigarette. He paced adamantly, &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he commanded, when he saw my\neyes open. Somehow I was sentenced to live with this family and it felt\nso foreign to me. Oh, what a task it was to move. My body felt paralyzed\ninitially, as if it were filled with lead.</p>\n\n<p>As disconcerting as it was to return to this world, I knew what I had to\ndo. I dragged my sandbagged legs across the floor and reached up to tear\na pot leaf poster off the bedroom wall. My dad stood incredulous. His\nmouth dropped open in disbelief, his eyes widened. &ldquo;Do you want me to\nget rid of this?&rdquo; he asked. I nodded and proceeded to rip down another\nblack light poster of Uncle Sam giving the finger. My dad just shook his\nhead and muttered, &ldquo;Unbelievable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I could feel his heart lifting as my body grew lighter with every\nmovement. I turned more lights on and proceeded to clear my room of\nclutter, surrendering all the paraphernalia I had stashed. I stopped\nusing drugs that night.</p>\n\n<p>With the support of some wonderful teachers, I became an honor roll\nstudent, and learned to meditate while still in high school. I was\nintroduced to the works of Dr. Elisabeth Kubler Ross and Dr. Raymond\nMoody, pioneers in the NDE movement. It helped put things in a new\ncontext for me. I am grateful for the inner experience and the\ncontinuing opportunity to explore this multidimensional world.</p>\n\n<p><tt> Kesha L.

2	about	Chicago IANDS began in May 1998, to provide a support and study group for those who have had a Near-Death Experience or are interested in the subject.  An independent, 501 (C-3) not-for-profit organization, it is one of many IANDS-affiliated groups around the world.\r\n\r\nIt is now estimated that there are over 25,000,000 near-death survivors in the United States, which is about 10% of the US population. These experiences often leave the experiencer with an expanded sense of reality which can often be better understood by sharing with others. Talking about an experience and/or listening to others talk about their experiences has a profound healing effect on many who participate.\r\n\r\nWe are especially grateful to all the researchers and near-death experiencers who pioneered the research in this field, making it possible for everyone to be able to speak freely about his/her experience.\r\n\r\nOur meetings are usually conducted around an aspect of the Near-Death Experience, often with supportive videos or a guest speaker. Time to discuss, share and socialize are included.\r\n\r\nMeetings are open to the public. We have no dues, however we ask everyone who is able to donate something to help offset our expenses such as guest speakers, postage, copier charges, flyers, refreshments and supplies. Suggested donation for meetings is $20. Follow your heart. No one is turned away. If you have NO money, the meeting is free. Otherwise please donate your fair share.   Our only income is generated at the door and through the bookstore. PLEASE DONATE YOUR FAIR SHARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Board of Directors:\r\n\r\n* President: Diane Willis\r\n* Vice-President: Marcia O'Hara\r\n* Sec'y/Treas: Sara Fieberg\r\n* Director: Gail Cotovsky\r\n* Director: Heidi Hetzel\r\n* Director: Susan Kortendick\r\n* Director: Erin Sullivan\r\n* Director: Vicki Nelson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 2008, Chicago IANDS announced the formation of a new not-for-profit organization, iSee (International Society for Extraordinary Experiences).
