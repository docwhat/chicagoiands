    <title>GUEST SPEAKER: Kathy Young from Ft. Lauderdale, FL.</title>
    <date>2000-06-10</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Our featured guest speaker for June, 2000, Kathy Young, will talk about her comprehensive near-death experience and transformation as the result of a violent crime. Hers is a powerful message of forgiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
KATHY YOUNG
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                            by Vanessa Bauza
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kathy Young sleeps in her shoes because short term memory loss makes it difficult to find them in the morning. She brushes her teeth over the kitchen sink to avoid her scarred reflection in the bathroom mirror. Her pockets are full of medicated drops to relieve the pain in her right eye, which no longer blinks. Hers is a life reconstructed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Five years ago this month, a neighbor slipped into her Fort Lauderdale home, beat her face in with a rifle butt, stabbed her seven times, raped her with a kitchen knife and sodomized her with the barrel of a shotgun. Her attacker, Rodney Wayne Jones, 45, lived down the street from Young but the two barely knew each other. While Jones got 22 years for attempted murder and other charges, Young says there are days she feels like she is serving a life sentence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A nurse for 12 years, Young, 40, now lives off a Social Security disability check and food donations from several charities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She has short term memory loss from brain injuries and is incontinent. Through it all she is committed to making her Flagler Heights neighborhood in northeast Fort Lauderdale a safer place. Since the attack, Young has become active in the Citizen's Crime Alert and is helping organize her community's National Night Out on Crime tonight at a nearby church.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hers is one of scores of South Florida communities throwing block parties to support grassroots crime fighting. Organizers hope the cookouts, SWAT demonstrations and kiddie games will build community spirit and increase ties between police officers and residents. In the past year, Young has attended citizen's police academy programs through the Fort Lauderdale Police department and the Broward Sheriff's Office. She also completed the Broward County Fire Rescue Civilian Emergency Response Team program to give her a better idea of what police deal with on a daily basis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Young's dream is to start a support group for survivors of violent crimes, something she said she hasn't been able to find. "I want to be the spark," Young said. "People have been disabled by crime. There's a small minority of survivors but it's out there and I want to reach it." Young started to organize her neighborhood by walking door-to-door and handing out fliers for homeowner association and crime watch meetings. Now some streets have been closed to limit traffic and Citizen Crime Watch signs are posted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cal Deal, past president of Citizens Crime Alert in Fort Lauderdale, said Young has been instrumental in spurring neighbors' to band against crime -- be it by condemning dilapidated houses, organizing block parties or simply keeping an eye on each other's homes. "She's come out to the meetings and pushed people," Deal said. "She was trying to save Flagler Heights. The bad guys see this stuff and it affects them. It changes the chemistry of the
neighborhood. It's second, I think, only to what the police do."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For Young, taking back her neighborhood is another mile marker on the road to recovery. Because of her brain injuries diagnosed this spring, Young takes hours completing simple tasks like showering and dressing. Her house is peppered with notes and daily reminders. Because she is incontinent, she plans errands days in advance and carefully regulates her diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The past five years have been full of adjustments great and small. Sometimes it's the little things she misses about her old life, like wearing her cheetah print or blue satin high heels. She still hasn't had the heart to give them away though she knows she'll never wear them again because of trouble balancing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, everyday she finds it a little easier to let the attack go. In October, she saw her trauma room photos for the first time. They show Young's face swollen, smeared with blood and crisscrossed with tubes. For Young, they have made the attack more real, helping her get over a stage of denial. "They might be gruesome to other people but to me it was proof that it really happened," she said. "I thought for long time that this was a bad dream. It took me a long time but I woke up."
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GUEST SPEAKERS: Three parents discuss their Children's Past Lives</title>
    <date>2001-10-13</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body> &lt;p&gt;Carol Bowman is unable to appear due to illness.   She is rescheduled for March, 2002.  The program is revised to include three speakers from Ms. Bowman's books:  Mary Flemming, Coleen Hocken, and Billy Luke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Some very young children remember their previous lives and deaths spontaneously, without prompting or hypnosis.  It is a natural phenomenon that has profound implications for parents as well as anyone curious to know what happens after death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Carol Bowman, author of Children's Past Lives and Return From Heaven, will share heartwarming stories that make reincarnation real and personal.  She will also describe empirical scientific research that proves the reality of these memories and provides perhaps the best evidence yet for life after death.  For parents, she will explain how to identify past life memories in young children and the best way to respond to help heal phobias, emotional issues, and even physical symptoms stemming from past lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cases of reincarnation within the same family, which is a surprisingly common, yet unpublicized phenomenon, is the subject of her latest book, Return from Heaven.  Carol will open your eyes to the possibility that a young child in your extended family may be a beloved relative who died recently.  If you suspect that a child in your family shows signs of a past life, bring your own story to share.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;  Carol Bowman lives with her husband and two children near Philadelphia.   Since beginning her research into children's past lives, she has become recognized as a pioneer and leading expert in this new field, and is a leading spokesperson for reincarnation.  She lectures and writes to share the news of children's
past life memories with professional therapists, parents, and the general public.  She is devoted to promoting research into the phenomenon. Carol Bowman graduated from Simmons College and has a MS from Villanova University.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Carol is an experienced media personality and has appeared on many nationally syndicated television programs including Oprah, Good Morning America, the
Fox Network's Encounters, Unsolved Mysteries on NBC, documentaries on A&amp;amp;E and the Discovery Channel, and regional TV talk shows.  She has also
appeared on nationally syndicated radio programs, including the Laura Lee Show and the Art Bell Show.

    <title>GUEST SPEAKER:  Linda Morris,RN,PhD, NDE Researcher "Tales From the Light"</title>
    <date>2001-11-10</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Tales from the Light is a summary of the findings from eight years of research into the near-death experience. The speaker interviewed patients who had unusual recollections of a period of "unconsciousness" and interviewed nurses who have cared for patients with near-death experiences.  The findings may surprise you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Linda Morris,PhD, has been a critical care nurse for 25 years, specializing in cardiac and respiratory nursing.  She received a
bachelor's degree from SIU at Edwardsville, Illinois in 1976, a MS from Loyola U. in 1981; and a Ph.D. from the
U. of IL/Chicago in 1998.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Morris has been an instructor, guest lecturer, and assistant professor
for several colleges and universities in the Chicago area.  She is currently
a regional clinical educator for Adventist Health Systems, with offices at
Hinsdale Hospital and LaGrange Memorial Hospital.  She also owns a
consulting firm, specializing in continuing education programs for nurses
and other health professionals and has published extensively in the field of
critical care.  She is a nationally known speaker in her field, and has
presented most recently for the American Association of Critical Care Nurses
in Anaheim, California.  She has also presented her research for conferences
at the University of Chicago, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and
the International Association of Near-Death Studies in Seattle, Washington.

The topic of her dissertation, completed in 1998, was "The Nature and
Meaning of Near-Death Experiences to Patients and Critical Care Nurses".&lt;/p&gt;

                                                   Near-Death Studies. He received his B.S. in economics
                                                   and finance from St. John&amp;#65533;s University in 1968 and later
                                                   attended the Central Florida Film School.

                                                   In addition to operating an active real estate business in

                                                   exclusive Club Marakesh at both the Palm Beaches and
                                                   Westhampton Beach.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                                  Following his near-death experience,
                                                   Dougherty's life changed dramatically and he started the Mission of Angels Foundation,
                            through which he is a featured speaker on life-after-death issues, near-death
                            experiences, Marian apparitions, and more. The author is currently traveling
                            extensively and settles down from time to time near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and

    <title>GUEST SPEAKER:  Melvin Morse, MD, Where God Lives</title>
    <date>2002-04-13</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Melvin L. Morse is recognized in Woodword-White's &lt;i&gt;Best Doctors in
 America&lt;/i&gt; as one of the top pediatricians in the country. He has a busy
 private practice in the suburbs of Seattle, Washington, USA. Dr.
 Morse has researched near-death experiences in children and adults
 for over 15 years. He is married and has five children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 His interest in near-death experiences evolved from his experiences
 working in Critical Care Medicine at Seattle Children's Hospital; he
 published the first description of a child's near-death experience in medical literature and was funded by the National Cancer
 Institute to complete the first case control prospective study in near-death experiences. He was the head of the Seattle Study, the largest
 study in adults of the transformative aspects of the near-death
 experience to date.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Dr. Morse graduated with academic honors from George Washington
 University School of Medicine. He interned in Pediatrics at the
 University of California at San Francisco and then completed a
 residency in Pediatrics at Seattle Children's Hospital. He is the
 recipient of a National Service Research Award and spent two years
 studying brain tumors and leukemia, also at Seattle Children&amp;#65533;s
 Hospital.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 He divides his time between his private practice of medicine and his
 teaching responsibilities. He is a Clinical Associate Professor of
 Pediatrics at University of Washington, and developed the Pediatric
 teaching program for the Family Practice residency program at
 Valley General Hospital. He has won numerous teaching awards. Dr.
 Morse was a founder of the Pediatric Interim Care Center, one of the
 nation&amp;#65533;s first therapeutic foster homes for infants affected by prenatal
 exposure to cocaine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Dr. Morse's research has been featured in documentaries in Japan,
 Australia, France, Canada, England, and the United States. He has
 appeared on numerous television and radio shows, including 20/20,
 The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Turning Point, The Tom Snyder
 Show, the Larry King Show, Good Morning America, Dateline, and
 Unsolved Mysteries, and has been the subject of lengthy profiles in
 the Seattle Times, Tacoma News Tribune, and the Los Angeles
 Times. He has numerous scientific publications on death-related
 visions, including The Lancet and the American Medical
 Association&amp;#65533;s Pediatric Journal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Morse's first book,&lt;i&gt; Closer to the Light,&lt;/i&gt; was an international best
 seller and is published in 38 countries and 19 languages. It explored
 the near-death experiences of children. His best-selling second book,
 &lt;i&gt;Transformed by the Light,&lt;/i&gt; is a long term follow up of these children
 as adults, and documents the physical and psychological
 transformations resulting from near-death experiences. His third
 book,&lt;i&gt; Parting Visions,&lt;/i&gt; documents the entire range of spiritual visions
 associated with death and dying, including premonitions of death and
 after death visitations. It focuses on how we can use these
 experiences to help us to understand death, grief, and the often
 overlooked spiritual miracles in everyday life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In his newest book, &lt;i&gt;Where God Lives &lt;/i&gt;(Harper Collins, 2000), Dr. Morse reveals the area of the brain that is our biological link to the universe and shows us the secret of tapping into the universal energy to achieve healing, personal peace, and transcendence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
"Melvin Morse's, &lt;i&gt;Where God Lives,&lt;/i&gt; ushers in new research on near-death experiences for the twenty-first century.  It is an astonishing synthesis of medical, philosophical, and spiritual knowledge about life, the mind, and the afterlife." -Raymond A. Moody, Ph.D, M.D.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Melvin Morse has proven to be one of our most creative thinkers, a rare scientist who can not only evaluate the objective evidence but also comprehend its larger implications.  In this book, he combines his own compelling personal experience with supporting scientific evidence to argue that there is a God Spot in our brains that allows us to interact with the spiritual universe.  Morse proposes that the lesson of NDEs is that we don't have to die to be with God, and in this book he shows us how."   -Bruce Greyson, M.D., Professor of Psychiatric Medicine, U of Virginia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Dr. Morse is one of the most informed and honest scientists currently studying the near-death experience.  His careful analysis of children who have had a Nde gives him a unique understanding of how the traditionally divergent roads of science and spirituality will come together to reassure and edify us all."  -Betty J. Eadie, author of &lt;i&gt;Embraced by the Light&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GUEST SPEAKER: Hospice Doctor Pam Kircher, author, "Love is the Link," will speak about The Death Process</title>
    <date>2002-05-11</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pam Kircher works in hospice in Durango, Colorado.  She is a very inspirational speaker who draws on her experience as a doctor as well as that of a near-death experiencer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Kircher graduated from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas
in 1979.  She completed her Family Practice Residency at the University of
Texas Health Science Center in Houston in 1982.  Upon completion of her studies, she remained in Houston where she had a
family practice from 1982-1990 and then became a
physician at the Texas Medical Center Hospice from 1990-1994.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  After moving to Durango, Colorado in 1994, Dr. Kircher practiced as a family physician until 1997.  She is now the Medical Director of the Wellness Center at Mercy Medical Center in Durango, where she is a member of the advisory board of the Hospice of Mercy and also maintains a counseling
practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

She published &lt;i&gt;Love is the Link: A
Hospice Physician Shares Her Experience of Near-Death and Dying&lt;/i&gt; in 1995 (Larson Publications).
Since that time, she has spoken locally and nationally about near-death
experiences and end-of-life issues and is serving as secretary on the Board of Directors of  the International Association for
Near-Death Studies (IANDS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;Love is the Link&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinary book, written by a physician who has undergone her own near-death experience.  Dr. Pamela Kircher writes with deep insight and great compassion.  This book is a valuable contribution to our understanding of both life and death, and will bring great comfort to anyone who reads it."  ---Larry Dossey, M.D., author of &lt;i&gt;Healing Words&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Recovering the Soul.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;tt/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;
"I have had the experience and heard the voice so I know the message of this book.   If this is not your life story, then read the book, hear the voice and change your life."  ---Dr. Bernie Siegel, author of &lt;i&gt;Love, Medicine and Miracles&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Stories of near-death and dying episodes collectively have come to constitute a wisdom teaching for the modern world.  Pamela Kircher, writing and working within the tradition established by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, has done a masterful job in this book of distilling the essence of this teaching and showing how each of us can learn from it.   &lt;i&gt;Love is the Link&lt;/i&gt;is an extremely valuable contribution to the death and dying literature, and I recommend it unreservedly to everyone---but especially to Dr. Kircher's fellow and sister physicians." ---Kenneth Ring, Ph.D., author of &lt;i&gt;Life at Death&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Heading Towards Omega&lt;/i&gt;

    <title>GUEST SPEAKER: Susan Wisehart, "Life Between Lives Regression"</title>
    <date>2002-07-13</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;LIFE BETWEEN LIFE REGRESSIONS involve going into the superconscious state to reveal&amp;nbsp;what happens in between incarnations in the spirit realm.  This experience often involves a meeting with your soul group, spirit guides and soul council.  The meeting with the soul council of wise beings is a compassionate and unconditionally loving review of your most immediate past life and your current life to better understand soul contracts, life purpose, and healing of repeating karmic patterns.  The meeting with your soul group assists in understanding the role that different souls play in your life, such as soulmates.  Most people report profound life transforming insights and experiences from this &amp;#65533;higher&amp;#65533; soul perspective.  The process lasts for 3 to 4 hours.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
SUSAN WISEHART,  M.S., NCSP, CHt, LMFT, is a Holistic Psychotherapist, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and Nationally Certified School Psychologist with a Masters degree in Psychology.  She has been in private practice for 19 years. She has a specialty in Past Life Regression Therapy and trained with Dr. Brian Weiss,author of &amp;#65533;Many Lives, Many Masters&amp;#65533;, and in England with Dr. Roger Woolger, author of &amp;#65533;Other Lives Other Selves&amp;#65533;.  Susan received further certification in life between life regressions with Dr.Michael Newton, author of &amp;#65533;Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls.&amp;#65533; &amp;nbsp;She is a member of the International Association for Regression Research and Therapies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

    <title>GUEST SPEAKER:  Robert Taub, Author of "Awakening in America"</title>
    <date>2002-08-10</date>
    <subtitle></subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In 1987 Robert Taub had an MBA, an interesting job with an airline, a brand new car, some great friends, and acquaintances to travel with, and was living in the River north area of Chicago.  He began, however, to become dissatisfied with his life, and discovered later that he was beginning to awaken spiritually.  In 1989 he left his job to become a technology consultant and instructor, which provided him with the flexibility for what would follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Severe health problems beginning in 1992 caused him to leave the mainstream and to engage in a semi-monastic life of reading, meditation and learning about holistic healing, while working part-time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Several days of vivid past-life recall, mystical, and near-death experience followed in February 2000, which resulted in the writing of "Awakening in America", the title of which was shown to him in a dream.  He lives and writes in Chicago and information on his upcoming projects may be obtained at &lt;a href="http://www.awakeninginamerica.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.awakeninginamerica.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Dr. Robert Magrisso, MD</title>
    <date>2002-09-14</date>
    <subtitle>Internist, Evanston (IL) Hospital, will speak about his own near-death experience. "Dying to Live:  Insights From a Near-Death Experience"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt; Robert Magrisso, M.D. is a general internist, in private practice in Winnetka, Illinois.  He is a Senior Attending physician on the staff of Evanston Northwestern Healthcare and has a teaching appointment on the faculty of Northwestern University Medical School.  In addition, he is an Associate Medical Director with Palliative Care Center of the North Shore.  His undergraduate work was in physics and he received a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University prior receiving his M.D. degree at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and his internal medicine training at State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y.  He moved here from New York City in 1982.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Dr. Magrisso has been a member of Cafh Order, a spiritual path, for over 25 years and serves as a spiritual director in that path.  He is married for over thirty years to Allegra Magrisso and they have 3 children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In 1995, Dr. Magrisso had a near fatal heart attack that was accompanied by a cardiac arrest, during which time he had a near-death experience.  He has spoken on his experience at medical grand rounds at Evanston Hospital and Cook County Hospital.  He has spoken on the general topic of "Life Threatening Illness and Spiritual Unfolding" at St. Louis University, C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago and at the national meeting of American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine in 2001 (the latter with Amy Peterman, PhD).  In addition, he has written numerous articles on spiritual themes for the journal &lt;i&gt;Seeds of Unfolding,&lt;/i&gt; including "Dying to Live - The Via Negativa of Renouncement."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He is also an artist and will be having a exhibit in October at the ARC gallery at 734 N. Milwaukee Ave, Chicago, called "Inner Spaces - Constructions, Carvings and Collages," some of which relate to the near-death experience.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Caroline Sutherland </title>
    <date>2002-10-12</date>
    <subtitle>Medical Intuitive, Near-Death Experiencer, and author of "The Body Knows."</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Studying with Caroline Sutherland has made a positive difference in my health.  I feel younger than I did five years ago.  Hay House is proud to publish her significant book."
			--Louise L. Hay, author of&lt;u&gt; You Can Heal Your LIfe&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Caroline Sutherland:  Near-Death Experiencer, Medical Intuitive and author of The Body &amp;#65533;Knows,&amp;#65533;  will be guest speaker at the October meeting of Chicago IANDS on October 12, at 2 pm, at the Unity Church on the North Shore, 3434 Central, in Evanston.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The gift of medical intuition came to Caroline Sutherland quite suddenly, in 1985, when she   was a physician&amp;#65533;s assistant and diagnostician for a very busy medical doctor who was practicing Environmental Medicine.  She had been trained in the use of very specific diagnostic allergy testing equipment and at a certain point, after using the equipment for about a year, she would hear a very distinct voice guiding her to areas of the body and telling her to test specific substances which were not ordered on the test forms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This gift has continued for the past 16 years and Caroline has now worked with over 60,000 people in both clinical settings and private consultations during this time.  Her medical intuitive ability is very specific to the physical body.  Because of an extensive background in Environmental Medicine, she can see the body from that perspective and can immediately read all of the foods that a person is allergic/sensitive to, see the main systems which are &amp;#65533;down&amp;#65533;, the state of the GI tract, immunity, hormone imbalances, weight problems, underlying causes and when they may have begun and what precipitated them etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She does not need to be in the physical presence of the person. All she needs to know is their name and a little about them, hear their voice or see a photo. The minute she connects with the person seeking her help, she is given a flood of data. The information is very specific, but the imbalances are only part of the picture. She can also see the &amp;#65533;correction&amp;#65533; ---what is needed to bring the body back into balance in terms of diet, supplements, botanicals, homeopathy and associated modalities. Often, she can hold a bottle of vitamins or any other substance that a person is taking and know whether it is beneficial or not. Among other perceptions, she has a sense of timing---how long it will take the person to re-balance and whether or not that individual will be compliant or if indeed they are likely to recover.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Two significant spiritual events helped Caroline to evolve into her current leadership role.  One was an &amp;#65533;angelic encounter&amp;#65533; in 1985, which led Caroline to start her world-wide children&amp;#65533;s ministry through the use of &amp;#65533;Angels for Kids&amp;#65533;---angel dolls and visualization audio tapes to comfort children.  And in 1995, Caroline had a brief but powerful glimpse of the other side when she was in a serious automobile accident, which was a further catalyst for her work as a medical intuitive.  On October 12, she will talk about both of these experiences as well as her work, and those people attending the meeting will have an opportunity to sign up for individual assessments.

&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Guest Speaker: Asia Voight </title>
    <date>2002-11-09</date>
    <subtitle>Animal Communicator and Near-Death Experiencer</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
In December of 1987, Asia Voight was in a life-threatening car accident which resulted when a semitrailer ran into her van.  She was trapped inside as a wall of fire burned all around her. Miraculously she survived. She spent three months in the Intensive Care Unit, and another nine months in the hospital. Asia had 4 near death experiences. Two of them she remembers clearly and will be sharing with you.  She will also talk about the results of her experiences and how she came to talk to animals.
Asia comments, "I have
really used this horrific accident as an opportunity to see the world from a
spiritual perspective. It has opened my eyes to a new level of love."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the car accident, Asia was awakened to reconnect with her inborn
ability to communicate with animals.

She began her professional work in August 1998 after studying advanced
levels of animal communication with Penelope Smith. She has enjoyed working
with over 4000 animals and also teaches workshops in animal communication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Asia's work has been featured on television, in magazines, and in Dr. Julie
Kaufmans's book,&lt;i&gt; Crossing the Rubicon: Celebration of the Human-Animal Bond
in Life and Death.&lt;/i&gt;  Asia has also appeared as a keynote speaker at the Midwest Horse Fair,
Madison, WI, 2000, and at the Wellness Conference, Madison, WI, 2001.

She earned a degree in Communication Arts from the University of
Wisconsin-Oshkosh. She has also worked as a midwife's assistant, cranial-sacral therapist, and healer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We hope you can join us to hear Asia tell her story and to continue sharing
inspiration, information and support together.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Dr. Allan Botkin, Psy.D. </title>
    <date>2002-12-14</date>
    <subtitle>Clinical Psychologist and After Death Researcher</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years Dr. Botkin has been experimenting with variations of a new and very powerful psychological procedure called eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). He discovered that one variation of this procedure results in an experience that nearly all patients believe is actual communication with the deceased---regardless of their prior beliefs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a new, cutting edge technique in which a near-death-like state is induced which allows someone who is grieving to meet with the deceased on the other side and have an interactive conversation which heals their grief.  This process can take as little as 10 minutes and can sometimes heal the grief of those who have been in therapy for years.  As of today, Dr Botkin and his colleagues have induced well over 2000 ADCs (After Death Communications).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Allan Botkin  has been a practicing psychologist since 1983.  He is currently a clinical psychologist at the VA Medical Center in North Chicago, Illinois, where he developed the Intensive Trauma Program (ITP), which preliminary studies indicate is one of the most effective in the country.1  He maintains a private practice in Libertyville, Illinois.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Botkin&amp;#65533;s expertise in his specialty has long been respected by the psychotherapeutic community, as indicated by the publication of &amp;#65533;Case studies of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder&amp;#65533; in the journal, &lt;i&gt;Psychotherapy, &lt;/i&gt;by Lipke and Botkin (1992). His most recent article &amp;#65533;The Induction of After-Death Communications Utilizing Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing: A New Discovery,&amp;#65533; appeared in the&lt;i&gt; Journal of Near-Death Studies,
&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 18, No. 3, Spring 2000.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He holds a Psy.D in clinical psychology from Baylor University, an M.A. in clinical psychology from Illinois State University, and a B.A. in psychology from the University of Kansas.   He is currently writing a book about this new process: &lt;i&gt; Reconnections: A New Psychological Discovery for Healing Grief and Trauma. &lt;/i&gt; His most recent public discussion of this technique was on Art Bell&amp;#65533;s show in Nov, 2002.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
1&amp;#65533;The Intensive Trauma Program (ITP) at the North Chicago VA Medical Center: A New Approach to the Treatment of Traumatic memories&amp;#65533; presented at the PTSD Outcomes Symposium at Hines VA Medical Center, Hines, Illinois, September 1998 by Botkin, et al.

    <date>2003-02-08</date>
    <subtitle>Minister of Unity in Chicago and Near-Death Experiencer</subtitle>
    <body>
&lt;p&gt;
Rev. Ed Townley is senior minister at Unity in Chicago, one of the liveliest
and fastest-growing New Thought spiritual centers in the world. He had an intense Near-Death Experience in September, 1975, which was instrumental in his becoming a Unity minister.  He studied at the Unity School of Religious Studies and was ordained in
1991, after earlier careers as actor, director and playwright in New York
City, Chicago and elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before returning to his home congregation at Unity in Chicago in 1998, he
spent seven years of ministry in Oregon, including five as senior minister
at Unity of Beaverton. His twin passions for the creative process and for
empowering ministry resulted in the founding of Spirit Expressing. In its
early years in Oregon, the Spirit Expressing ministry included a weekly
television program, quarterly magazine, acting classes, writing workshops
and a performance company. Now an integral part of Unity in Chicago, Spirit
Expressing today is an umbrella comprised of artists, performers, musicians,
designers, technicians, writers, a quarterly newsmagazine, various creative
arts classes and an active website that boasts, among other things, a weekly
web program in which Rev. Ed interviews outstanding spiritual voices from
throughout the world.  He is also the author of &lt;i&gt; Meditations on the Mount,&lt;/i&gt; a
practical guide to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount and his personal story is
featured in Studs Terkel's latest best-selling book, &lt;i&gt;Will the Circle Be
Unbroken?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to his ministry, Ed is a featured speaker in churches and other
venues throughout the United States, and serves on the Advisory Board of the
Association for Global New Thought.  His Sunday talks, daily messages and
interview program are available on the Unity in Chicago website at:

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj</title>
    <date>2003-04-12</date>
    <subtitle>"Meditation and the Near-Death Experience"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;"If we can realize ourselves as soul, and bring the soul to a point in the body known as the seat of the soul, it will come in contact with the stream of Divine Light and Sound."
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
H.H. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj, head of Sawan Kirpal Ruhani
Mission/Science of Spirituality, is internationally recognized for his work

&lt;p&gt;
    He travels throughout the world, conducting meditation seminars, giving
talks on inner enlightenment, and sharing his message through radio and
television with millions of people. He has written several books and numerous
articles about spirituality in which he frequently uses the near-death experience as an example of what one can achieve through meditation.  They have  been translated into many languages.
Two of his books, &lt;i&gt;Inner and Outer Peace Through Meditation,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Empowering Your Soul
through Meditation&lt;/i&gt; were published by Element Books. They will be available
through HarperCollins in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;
    Actively committed to human unity and harmony, Sant Rajinder Singh Ji
Maharaj has been honored by religious leaders and heads of state worldwide.
He sponsors and participates in interfaith activities in America, Europe, and
India, where hundreds of thousands come together to focus on spirituality,
human unity, and religious fellowship. Recognizing the transcendent oneness
at the heart of all religions, he emphasizes prayer and meditation as the
true building blocks for achieving peace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

1994, at the World Conference on Religion and Peace in Italy. He was
president of the Seventh World Religions Conference, held in 1994 in Delhi,
India, where he was host to the first international, interfaith spiritual
dialogue on the connection between prayer, meditation, and nonviolence. In
1995 in New York, he participated in programs honoring the 50th Anniversary
of the United Nations, during which he led thousands of people in meditation.
He was president of the 16th International Human Unity Conference, held in
India in September 1996 and attended by over 100,000 people representing 36
countries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    Born in India, H.H. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj received his spiritual
education from two of India's spiritual giants: H.H. Sant Kirpal Singh Ji
Maharaj and H.H. Sant Darshan Singh Ji Maharaj. He took his M.S. degree in
engineering in the United States and had a distinguished 20-year career in
science and communications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj presents spirituality clearly and
directly. Advocating a balance between inner and outer life, he encourages
people to fulfill their responsibilities to family and society while pursuing
a spiritual life of inner contemplation and personal development. Dedicated
to helping humanity, he says, "It is only when each individual has achieved
inner peace that we will see lasting outer peace in the world."

N.B.: NEW LOCATION - Frank Auditorium at Evanston Hospital, 2650 Ridge Ave (&amp; Central St), Evanston.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prompted by a Near-Death-Experience, Joyce Hawkes, Ph.D. (Biophysics)  embarked on a radical change in professional focus in 1984.  After 15 years as a respected and prolific research scientist (author of 50 scientific papers, Fellow with the NIH, Fellow with American Association of Advancement of Science, International lecturer in cell biology) she set aside her career to pursue an intensive exploration of spiritual and healing traditions.  She spent extended periods of time in the Philippines, England, India, and Bali working with healers and spiritual leaders, discovering how many indigenous healers come to their calling through NDE's.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Appearing on national and local TV (Good Morning America, Jan, 2002), guest of Art Bell on Coast to Coast Radio (Mar, 2002), frequent speaker at Science and Consciousness Conferences in NM, and Distinguished Contributor to the International Institute of Integral Human Sciences (May, 2003), Joyce combines her knowledge and expertise as a scientist and the wisdom of her heart as a healer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Dr. Hawkes will be doing healings while she is in Chicago on Sunday and Monday, April 11 and 12. To schedule an appointment, call Chicago IANDS at 847.251.5758.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Kimberly Clark Sharp</title>
    <date>2003-09-13</date>
    <subtitle>Social Worker, Near-Death Experiencer and Author of "After the Light"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;/p&gt;
Kimberly Clark Sharp, M.S.W., has earned the title of &amp;#65533;Near-Death Comedienne&amp;#65533; through her many presentations about near-death experiences.  She is the founder and president of the Seattle International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS), the oldest and largest group of its kind in the world. A clinical social worker, Sharp has taught at the University of Washington School of Medicine and at Seattle University. She lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband and children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her book,&lt;i&gt; After the Light,&lt;/i&gt; is a near-death classic, educating thousands about the near-death experience with much humor and tact, delivering the serious message that we do not die in an irresistibly humorous package.  It is difficult to put her book down once you begin to read.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Death is nothing to fear - and life without fear can be lived to the fullest."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is Kimberly Clark Sharp's message from her extraordinary experience during the time after her heart suddenly stopped beating and she lay on the sidewalk, not breathing, and without a pulse. Swept into a peaceful loving place of brilliant golden light and warm comfort, she saw, for the first time, the meaning of life - and death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thereafter, Kimberly, with hamster Toto at her side, left Kansas for Seattle - known as "the Emerald City" -- to fulfill a destiny devoted to the service of others as foreseen at the end of her near-death experience. Guided by a new sensitivity to the presence of angels, demons and other invisibilities, Kimberly attained a Masters degree in Social Work at the University of Washington and began a career in medical social work that put her in direct contact with dying people - and people who almost died and came back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is the inspirational stories of these near-death experiences, as well as Kimberly's own life challenges in love, family life and the diagnosis of breast cancer, that form the core of this surprisingly funny page-turner of a book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bettie J. Eadie, Author of Embraced by the Light said,  "Kimberly Clark Sharp is truly an exciting and loved spokesperson for the near-death movement. Kim will tantalize and fascinate you as she shares...her extraordinary life of service to the seen and unseen."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Raymond Moody, author of Life After Life, and father of the Near-Death Experience:  "The spirited and spritual Kimberly Clark Sharp opens a new door to the aftereffects of her near-death experience and shows us the supernatural worlds that surround the living and await the dying"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Melvin Morse, author of Closer to the Light adds:  "No one has done more with the near-death experience to serve others than Kimberly Clark Sharp. She was one of the earliest influences on my own understanding of near-death experiences."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other comments:
"Experiencer, researcher, clinician...nobody tells it better or with more humor than Kim. A delightfully entertaining writer and a very wise soul."
~ Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. Author of Heading Toward Omega
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kimberly Clark-Sharp has produced a remarkable book about her own near-death experience (NDE) and its effects on her life. For many readers, any well-written NDEbook (and this is surely one) will be welcomed. For those uncounted who have been touched by Sharp over the years, this book is long overdue. For the remainder, this is still a book worth reading. It made me cry; it made me laugh; and it made me rethink some of my fundamental ideas. As Sharp might sing into her microphone, Who could ask for anything more?&amp;#65533;
~ Bruce Greyson, M.D., University of Virginia
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the Light is a spiritual roller coaster ride I kept thinking would end, but never did. The book begins with a near-death-experience (NDE) in 1970, and then fast forwards through the miraculous and the incredible as author Kimberly Clark Sharp shares how a byproduct of her NDE, a spiritual-opening-up, allowed her to walk simultaneously in two worlds.
~ Rick Montgomery, from Angel Times

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D.</title>
    <date>2003-10-11</date>
    <subtitle>Professor, U of Arizona, and Author of "The Afterlife Experiments"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D., is professor of psychology, medicine, neurology, psychiatry and surgery at the University of Arizona and director of its Human Energy Systems Laboratory.  After receiving his doctorate from Harvard University, he served as a professor of psychology and psychiatry at Yale University, director of the Yale Psychophysiology Center, and co-director of the Yale Behavioral Medicine Clinic.  He has published more than four hundred scientific papers, edited eleven academic books, and is the co-author, with Linda G. Russek, Ph.D., of &lt;i&gt; The Living Energy Universe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Schwartz' book,&lt;i&gt;The Afterlife Experiments:  Breakthrough Scientific Evidence of Life After Death,&lt;/i&gt;is a riveting narrative, with its electrifying transcripts, which puts the reader on the scene of a breakthrough scientific achievement: contact with the beyond under controlled laboratory conditions. In stringently monitored experiments, leading mediums attempted to contact dead friends and relatives of "sitters" who were masked from view and never spoke, depriving the mediums of any cues. The messages that came through stunned sitters and researchers alike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here, as they unfolded in the laboratory setting, are uncanny revelations about a son's suicide, what a deceased father wanted to say about his last days in a coma, the transformation of a man's lifelong doubts about the afterlife, and, most amazing of all, a forecast of a beloved spouse's death. Dr. Schwartz was forced by the overwhelmingly positive data to abandon his skepticism, reaching some startling conclusions.  Compelling from the first page to the last, &lt;i&gt;The After life Experiments&lt;/i&gt; is the amazing documentation of groundbreaking experiments.

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Howard Storm</title>
    <date>2003-11-08</date>
    <subtitle>Negative Near-Death Experiencer, Former University Art Professor, Pastor and Author of "My Descent into Death"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Howard Storm was born in Newton, MA, in 1946 and for many years, he lived the American dream.  He had a fine home, a family, and, for 20 years, a successful career as an artist and art professor at Northern Kentucky University. Like many of his colleagues in the academic community, he was an atheist, believing that "When you die, you die, and that's it."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In June, 1985, he took a group of his art students to Paris. Without warning, he found himself in the hospital in excruciating pain, awaiting an emergency operation and he realized with horror that his death was a real possibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Storm was totally unprepared for what was to happen next.  He found himself out of his body, staring at his own physical form.   But this was no hallucination; he was fully aware and felt more alive than ever before.  In his spirit form, Storm was drawn into fearsome realms of darkness and death, where he experienced the terrible consequences of a life of selfishness and materialism.  However, his journey also took him into regions of light where he conversed with angelic beings and the Lord of Light Himself, who sent him back to earth with a message of love.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following his near-death experience, his life was transformed.  He eventually studied to become a pastor and in 1992 was ordained in the United Church of Christ.  He now is pastor at Zion United Church of Christ in Cincinnati, Ohio.  On numerous occasions he has communicated the message he received from his experience to various groups and through the media, including the Oprah Winfrey Show, 48 hours and the Discovery Channel.  He wrote an account of his experience, "My Descent into Death," which was published in 2000.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
"...I consider Howard Storm's near-death experience one of the greatest that I am aware of..." ---George Ritchie, author of "Return From Tomorrow" and "Ordered to Return."

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Charles Graybar</title>
    <date>2003-12-13</date>
    <subtitle>Author of "Beyond the Broken Gate" who discovered a portal and found answers more detailed than an NDE.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Charles Graybar started out studying physics and other core sciences from his teenage years onward. In his early 20's, he shifted his focus and began a career in the media industry, and by 40, he had become senior vice president for Capital Cities/ABC, the parent company of ABC Television and had gained broad notoriety as an expert in the media business. Throughout his career he has been broadly quoted in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, USA Today and many national and international publications as well as making appearances on CNN's Moneyline. Since the 1980's Graybar has served on seven private company Boards of Directors and consulted to more than 30 Boards of Directors of corporations and not-for-profit organizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Despite his success in business as he reached his late 30's he began to see his life as ostensibly empty and lacking true purpose. While experimenting with a combination of meditation techniques as a means of escaping the stresses of corporate life, in late 1993 he came across a gateway of sorts; this "portal", accessed through his accidentally- discovered combination of meditation methodologies, ultimately facilitated the ability to communicate with, what was at first, an unidentifiable spiritual entity. Graybar initially dismissed this experience entirely due largely to his early scientific training. Most surprising of all though was that, several days later when he duplicated the methods he had used to access this unusual pathway, he was able to duplicate the experience including the unusual communication with the advanced spirit. The experiences were so acute and the insights gained through the spiritual entity so stunning that within a year of stumbling upon this unusual state of perception, Graybar left his secure corporate position and began a near full-time pursuit of spiritual investigation and search for enlightenment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Beyond the Broken Gate, rated #1 on BiggerBooks.com within two months of its release, is a chronicle of his search to find meaning in both his stunning
discovery and also the very purpose of life. Along this course, he transitioned enormously from a scientific orientation with no belief in "a God which cannot be proven" to a hard-charging corporate executive with "no belief in a God that allows the terrible people in the world to go unpunished" to a person whose entire life's purpose has become to walk through life with compassion as a dedicated spiritual person who acknowledges "our irrefutable and essential connection with God and each other." Beyond the Broken Gate details the spiritual entities' brilliant insights on questions such as; why we live, what we're meant to do in this life and what comes after this experience that we call life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Charles Graybar now looks back and acknowledges the many changes he has made in his life. "I made a rather substantial transformation from a hard-charging Fortune 100 senior executive to a guy that now raises horses and writes books for a living." Along with spending his time writing and tending to his horses, he is also a corporate board consultant in addition to a group speaker who shares his spiritual insights and life transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <subtitle>Near-Death Experiencer (2X) and Facilitator of Ft. Wayne (IN) IANDS, Ken "Reaches for Joy" despite many injuries received in a beating with baseball bats.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Ken Prather has had two Near-Death Experiences: the first one when he was 9 years old, and another one when he was 49 years old, as a result of being beaten by several men with baseball bats.  After the second NDE, he spent thirty-two days on life support, three months in a hospital, and three years in a long-term physical rehabilitation center.  He also had total organ failure and a broken back.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ken&amp;#65533;s amazing NDE has put him on a  spiritual path which has produced many miracles in his life, including an amazing healing which allowed him to walk again, after many months in a wheel chair.  Today, at age 54, Ken Prather is an inspiring Hospice Volunteer and Near-Death Counselor in Fort Wayne, IN, as well as the facilitator of Ft. Wayne IANDS.  He is also the founder of an outreach program, &lt;i&gt;Reaching For Joy.&lt;/i&gt;  He has had many articles written about his experiences and he is writing a book about them called &lt;i&gt;My Journey Back.&lt;/i&gt;  He also writes poetry and inspirational stories.

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Donna McCue</title>
    <date>2004-02-14</date>
    <subtitle>Near-Death Experiencer, Comedienne, author of &lt;i&gt;Your Fate is in Your Hands,&lt;/i&gt;Donna helps people through her humor and psychic ability.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Articulate, personable, and sparkling with humor and insight, Donna McCue has many exciting and memorable stories to tell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Donna is an author, comedienne, radio personality, intuitive consultant, as well as a wife and mother, who is based in East Hampton, New York. Vibrant and quick witted, Ms. McCue is a nationally known intuitive, celebrated locally as the "intuitive consultant to the stars."  She had an intense near-death experience which catapulted her into the work which she so successfully does.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In her twenty-five year practice of the art of intuition, Ms. McCue's clientele has ranged from newscasters to musicians, media personalities to stockbrokers. She has worked as a consultant with the FBI, and for corporations that include Home Box Office (for whom she forecast the future of the creative staff), and Merrill Lynch, who invited her to participate in a semiannual dinner for new brokers in the late eighties. During the dinner with Merrill Lynch employees, Ms. McCue found herself - much to her own surprise - telling at least forty of the attendees that she saw them leaving their jobs. Only days later Black Tuesday descended -- the market crashed and aggressive downsizing began.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. McCue has read the hands of many celebrities, artists and thinkers such as Willem De Kooning, Salvador Dali, William Styron and Faith Popcorn.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Previously a radio personality and standup comedienne, Ms. McCue has a live, call-in public television show, The Donna McCue Show, which can presently be seen on Long Island's Cablevision, and on Manhattan Cable television. Her show boasts a highly original combination of eclectic though accessible elements: wisdom wit, and hands-on healing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the early nineties, Ms. McCue was the numerology and astrology writer for Hampton Magazine. She presently gives corporate and private sector workshops and seminars, geared towards helping others to get in touch with their intuitive abilities through a series of simple interactive exercises. Her book,&lt;i&gt; Your Fate is in Your Hands,&lt;/i&gt; tells her personal story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aside from a full schedule of corporate events and seminars, Donna is raising her two sons with her husband, who she met while doing a reading back in 1981. "I read his hand and the first thing I blurted out was, 'You are going to marry me'. Without missing a beat he answered, 'If I'm going to marry you, perhaps we should have dinner first'." Two years later they were married.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Thomas Gates</title>
    <date>2004-03-13</date>
    <subtitle>Near-Death Experiencer, Founder of Soul Source, Author, Speaker, Healing Facilitator</subtitle>
    <body>

&lt;p&gt;
Thomas Gates was born in Texas in 1950 and was the fourth of five children. He grew up in the rural countryside not far from Dallas, where he and his brothers and sisters attended Catholic school. His father was a fireman, and his loving mother was a homemaker and the quiet spiritual leader of the family. At the age of twelve he began working as a professional musician and soon became an accomplished drummer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He spent much of his childhood playing in the woods, observing the stars, the sky, the trees, the animals, the changing of seasons, and the effortless flow of nature&amp;#65533;s way. As a result he sensed that there must be one simple and powerful essence sustaining all this incredibly diverse creation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Then, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Thomas learned Transcendental Meditation. This brought the experience of the underlying wholeness of all creation and confirmed his sense of what had been occurring in nature all along. This euphoria lasted about one week when he suddenly found himself being rushed to the hospital with a case of appendicitis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thomas found himself in what appeared to be a losing battle for his life.  Soon after the surgery, he heard the doctors announce to his father, "We're sorry.  We've done everything we can.  You should know that he might not mike it."  Within moments Thomas began an amazing and graceful journey all the way through and beyond the "light" to the underlying, eternal source of his own existence and that of all creation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the universe began to unfold before him, he experienced and understood many things about our creation. He encountered a magnificent golden light and was completely absorbed by its powerful, healing warmth.    The greatest gift was the confirmation that we are all eternal and inseparable from our source, from one another, or from any other particle of the universe.  This experience forever changed his perception and understanding of life as he began a new journey back into the realm of human existence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As he began to share his story with others, walking them through the journey, Thomas became aware that there appeared to be some subtle healing value experienced by those with whom he shared.  It seems to bring a greater sense of peace and increasing freedom from some underlying fears without specifically addressing any particular fears.  Fear is an illusion created by the belief and the resulting experience that we are separate from the source of our whole ness and its presence in all points of creation.   With the spontaneous collapse of fear more wholeness is revealed.  This can bring into our lives more than just the memory of who we really are but, in fact, the experience of who we really are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Thomas was given the gift to draw from that same brilliant, golden light he had encountered in his journey which brings spectrums that enliven the body&amp;#65533;s natural physical and emotional healing process. The spectrums not only facilitate pain relief but also help release the underlying remnants of trauma in the physiology that give rise to physical and emotional dysfunction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
&amp;#65533;When I heard Thomas share his story I was impressed by his simple and graceful manner of speaking. He was able to clearly describe something that is almost beyond description."&lt;/i&gt;--Radha Nayar, Consultant/CPA
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
"Thomas Gates is an exceptional speaker with an extraordinary message.  The story of his profound near-death experience conveys a deep sense of peace and an understanding of the eternal connection that we all have to one another."&lt;/i&gt; --Loni Parrott, Founder and Facilitator, Iowa City, IA IANDS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
"I had just hurt my ankle and was limping badly when I had a session with Thomas.  I immediately began to feel heat in the ankle and then a soothing coolness as the pain disappeared.  After the session I stood up and walked without any pain whatsoever.  I never had a problem with it again."&lt;/i&gt; --MM, Fairfield, IA, Consultant

She is a professional workshop presenter and a television consultant on PNI (psychoneuro-immunology) concepts and near-death experiences.  She has trained with Dr. Bernie Siegel and Dr. Jerry Jampolsky to facilitate cancer support groups and with Dr. Martin Rossman and Dr. David Bressler on advanced clinical guided imagery work.  Her spiritual path has been a blending of many traditions and is mostly intuitive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ingrid&amp;#65533;s background includes a lineage of mystics and psychics.  Her Grandmother was a healer, an Uncle was a psychic, and her maiden name &amp;#65533;Ingrasci&amp;#65533; means &amp;#65533;with grace&amp;#65533; in Italian.  Although she had inklings as a child of her spiritual guidance, it was not until she had a near-death experience at the age of eighteen that she became fully spiritually awakened.   Her struggle with cancer from ages 16 to 31 also included many spiritual interventions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In her life&amp;#65533;s work, Ingrid is strongly committed to personal empowerment through spiritual and educational integration.  She has authored and now teaches an interactive mind/body/spirit workshop called &lt;i&gt;Renewing Life,&lt;/i&gt; designed for people with life threatening illnesses.  This program has been endorsed by nationally known author and speaker, Dr. Joan Borysenko, and is integrated into cancer centers in nine states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, Ingrid teaches ESP  (Empowerment, Spirituality, and Purpose) workshops to help participants develop a spiritually guided path.  She has co-presented a Chakra Workshop through a complimentary medicine center and also directs a non-profit organization, Insight Dynamics, Inc., which provides transformational workshops on psychoneuro-immunology and near-death experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Dilley lives in Madison, WI, with her husband.  She is a mother of five children in a blended family of yours, mine and ours, and is a step-grandmother of five.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Linda Jacquin</title>
    <date>2004-05-08</date>
    <subtitle>2 NDEs, Vice President of the International Association for Near-Death Experiences, Advertising Executive</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Linda Jacquin&amp;#65533;s first NDE occurred when she was 4 years old, so she has benefited from the effects for most of her life.   Her second NDE occurred at age 40, ten days after her brother&amp;#65533;s death.  He appeared to her in both NDEs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After becoming a member of International Association for Near-Death Studies, Linda joined the Board of Directors in 1999 and is now Vice President.  At the 1997 IANDS conference in San Antonio, TX, Linda met Andy Naytahow, chief and medicine man for his Native Cree Indian tribe at Joseph Big Head, in Canada.  She was adopted into the Cree nation and renamed Bear Woman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A charming and personable speaker, Linda has given many talks on the Near-Death Experience in the United States and Canada.  She has been interviewed on television and was featured in the film,&lt;i&gt; Cheating Death: Beyond and Back.&lt;/i&gt;  She has also written articles about the Near-Death Experience and was a consultant for the children&amp;#65533;s book, &lt;i&gt;Near-Death Experiences &lt;/i&gt;(Capstone Press), which will be released in August, 2004.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the last twenty years, Linda has been president of Jacquin Advertising, a promotional products and marketing company in St. Louis.  She has raised a family of three children and is now the proud grandmother of Jacob.  She is also looking forward to getting her registration with the state of Missouri to become a hospice volunteer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
Please note:  The previously announced speaker for this date, Dan Rico, has been cancelled.

    <title>Guest Speakers:  Catherine Chiesa and Jack Bonczyk</title>
    <date>2004-06-12</date>
    <subtitle>Near-Death Experiencers from our own group, Chicago IANDS, will tell their stories and discuss them with the audience.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Jack Bonczyk, 53, had his NDE in 1972 as a result of having a car fall on him, which broke his spinal column.   He had been under the car, preparing it for an interview with Hot Rod magazine.    One of the supports collapsed and the car fell on Jack.    He was taken to the hospital, had surgery, and was expected to die.  After the operation. he flatlined for about 4  minutes.    While the medical team feverishly worked to revive him, Jack woke up in the corner of the room watching them, listening to the talk about what they were going to do.  " I suddenly realized I was in the corner watching them and I was the one in bed. "
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
"The next thing I knew I was falling down a well shaft.  At first I tried to stop myself.  I saw  bright light and I realized I was dying.  I knew I was headed to a soft and comfortable place.  And I knew everything would be fine.   I let go and started to fall faster.  Looking back was horrible---the world is filled with such mean people.  Meanwhile  I dropped for what seemed like four hours.   I woke up in the hospital room, three days later. "
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Jack was in the hospital for two years.   Initially, he was paralyzed from the chest down, but while in the hospital, he learned how to talk to the cells in his body and gradually released the paralysis.    After seven years of working on this, he had released the paralysis down to the mid-calf.   He still wears braces on both ankles so he can walk.   He is now a commercial airline pilot.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Catherine Chiesa, 69, is the mother of three (one deceased) and grandmother of five.  In 1957, as she was about to deliver her first child,  she suddenly found herself  "way far out" in a bright illuminated tunnel.  "It was effervescent---so beautiful and peaceful.   The feeling of being completely safe ---and HOME.   I kept trying to reach out more.   It was as though I could touch this main Source of Power.   It felt like God or Jesus.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
The space was so vast, I can't describe it.  Then I heard a voice say  'You have to go back.   You have a little boy.   It is not your time.'   Disappointment could not describe what I felt.   I did NOT want to go back at all!   I found myself descending, floating back into my body in the hospital---and I was back.  I knew I couldn't tell others about this because everyone would think I was crazy.   But now, when so many others have also experienced this I can share.  It is such a blessing."

    <title>CHICAGO CONFERENCE:   CREATIVITY FROM THE LIGHT!</title>
    <date>2004-06-24</date>
    <subtitle>Don't miss the big international IANDS conference at the Best Western - University Plaza in Evanston, IL, June 24-26. </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
Three whole days of fabulous speakers! Three days of Healing Connection with the best healers available which represent some of the gifts that people acquire through their near-death experiences! Music, Art, Writing, and more skills will be demonstrated, discussed, enjoyed.  A world of talented individuals sharing their amazing skills!
&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS),  in conjunction with the local chapter, Chicago IANDS, will present its annual conference:  "Creativity from the Light," on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, June 24-26, 2004 at the Best Western University Plaza Hotel in Evanston, IL, which will explore the creativity which is often released during a near-death experience.  Many near-death experiencers (NDErs) come back from their experiences with heightened sensitivities and miraculous gifts, e.g. increased intuitive ability, healing ability, and on other occasions, with artistic gifts, such as the ability to improvise music, paint beautiful artworks or make significant literary contributions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many well-known personalities have benefited from the gifts of the NDE:  Peter Fonda, Elizabeth Taylor, Christopher Reeve, Sharon Stone, David Letterman, R. Carlos Nakai, Howard Dean,  Johnny Cash, and Burt Reynolds, to name a few of the very long list.  It is estimated that there are now over 23,000,000 near-death survivors in the United States today.   This very common phenomenon brings not only tangible, creative gifts, but also spiritual ones:  an ability to view the world from a higher perspective, a greater sense of peace, more understanding of the nature of the the Universe, a connection to a higher power, and a loss of fear of dying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
IANDS will bring from England, Peter Fenwick, M.D., an internationally known neuropsychiatrist who is one of the world's leading NDE researchers;  California artist, Andy Lakey, whose stunning angel paintings now fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars, and who had never painted before his NDE;  Talented medical intuitive and NDEr, Caroline Sutherland, from Vancouver, B.C.; and NDEr, comedienne and intuitive, Donna McCue, from Long Island, NY.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-two more speakers include well-known NDE researcher, PMH Atwater, University of Illinois/Chicago professors, Steve Fanning (History) and Neal Grossman (Philosophy), Jungian psychologist Dr. Robert Moretti, discussing Jung's two NDEs; psychologist Dr. Allan Botkin, After-Death Communications (ADCs); Evanston internist, Dr. Robert Magrisso, well-known Chicago minister, Rev. Ed Townley, and Asia Voight, who has had four NDEs and can communicate with animals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A Pre-Conference lecture by David Kessler, "Using Your Experiences and Creativity in the Service of Others:  Your Mission in End-of Life Care." will be open to the public on Wednesday evening, June 23, 7 pm, at the Music Institute of Chicago (Auditorium) at 1490 Chicago Ave., Evanston.  For the cost of $35. each person will also receive a copy of David's best-selling book, The Needs of the Dying, and afterward, a chance to meet David at a reception with live music.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
David Kessler is fast gaining a reputation as one of the best known experts in the field of hospice and end-of-life care, as a result of reaching hundreds of thousands of people through his books.  His newest book is LIFE LESSONS: two experts on death and dying teach us about the mysteries of life and living, which is co-authored with Elisabeth K&amp;uuml;bler Ross, who will be receiving IANDS' 2004 Lifetime Achievement Award at this year's conference.  His work has been often discussed in the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, Business Week and Life Magazine and has been featured on CNN-Cross Fire, NBC, MSNBC, PBS, Entertainment Tonight and Sally Jessy Raphael.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other exciting events during the conference include a three-day Healing Connection, which, for a registration fee of $7, conference attendees can sample up to 60 minutes of healing sessions with some of the outstanding healers who have been the recipients of NDE "gifts."  Healing, palmistry, network chiropractic, rune stone readings, medical intuitive assessments and animal communication readings (please bring photo, not the animal!) are among the offerings available.  Also included are a bookstore run by Transitions Bookplace, Chicago's best spiritual bookstore, an Art Exhibit with examples of "Creativity from the Light," and Silent and Live Auctions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One can attend the whole conference, one day, or selected lectures.  Five people can attend the whole conference for the price of four.  Registration is available online at www.iands.org.---Or by calling 860.882.1211, the national headquarters of IANDS in Hartford, CT.  Brochures will also be available through Chicago IANDS:  847.251.5758.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
WELCOME TO CHICAGO!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Chicago IANDS is getting ready to welcome YOU to the windy city!   We have been working hard to organize the best IANDS conference ever with fabulous speakers and entertainers whose creativity blossomed after their near-death experiences.  We have reserved a beautiful little hotel about five blocks from Lake Michigan, which will make it possible to walk along the beach early in the morning and watch the sun rise over the water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The hotel rooms are lovely, with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows with a view of either the Chicago skyline and Lake Michigan ---or Evanston and Lake Michigan.  The hotel is located  in the center of Evanston, IL, a block from the elevated train, on which one can ride from O'Hare or Midway airports, or anywhere in the city, for only $1.80.  Outside of the hotel, the Evanston Art Fair will be in full swing on Saturday and Sunday---a perfect setting for our conference theme:  "Creativity from the Light."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Evanston boasts some of the best restaurants in the Chicagoland area, most at very reasonable prices, and many within a few blocks of the hotel.  There are galleries and museums, and even the Kohl Children's Museum is in the area.  It will be easy to have a great time in Evanston if that is your sole destination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However....if you are blessed with a few extra days or can spend your vacation in the area, you can take advantage of one of the most beautiful cities in the world:  Chicago.   There isn't room to even begin to list all there is to do in Chicago, which is about 30 minutes (12 miles) south of Evanston.  Some of my favorites places are the Art Institute, the Field Museum of Natural History, and Navy Pier, an amusement pier which extends into Lake Michigan beneath Oprah Winfrey's apartment windows.  Navy Pier's enormous Ferris wheel is also a great way to see the city.   And there are riverboat rides down the Chicago River through the heart of the city, two zoos, the"miraculous mile"--- a shopper's paradise, and the American Girl's store, which all girls of any age will enjoy.  And don't forget the Museum of Science and Industry, the Shedd Aquarium  and the Adler Planatarium!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ethnic communities alone would make the trip worthwhile.  You can go to Vietnam, Poland, China, Sweden, and many other countries---right here. Chicago has more Poles than Warsaw!  Second City and other theater groups abound, and Ravinia, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra is a very special outdoor experience.  The beach, the parks, the opportunities are endless....
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That's the setting....all we need is you!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Register now for the next &lt;a href="http://www.iands.org/conf.html"&gt;IANDS North American Conference!&lt;/a&gt; The first 200 registrants also receive a free copy of Andy Lakey's beautiful $30 book, &lt;i&gt;Art, Angels and Miracles,&lt;/i&gt; which will be distributed at the conference check-in desk.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Thomas Gates, NDEr, Healing Facilitator and video:  THE DAY I DIED</title>
    <date>2004-08-14</date>
    <subtitle>Don't miss this opportunity to view the complete BBC video which the conference goers loved---and be a part of a powerful group healing by Thomas Gates.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Due to a family emergency, our scheduled speaker, Katelyn Daniels will not appear at this meeting.   HOWEVER----we have a fabulous  alternative:   A viewing of the amazing BBC film, "The Day I Died," which was  enthusiastically received at the IANDS Conference in June.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AND MORE---a powerful group healing by Thomas Gates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1972 Thomas Gates was given an opportunity to take an extensive and amazing journey all the way through the light and beyond, to the underlying, eternal source of our existence and that of all creation.  As the Universe unfolded before him, he realized that we are all eternal and inseparable from our source, from one another, and from every other particle of the Universe.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many years later Thomas realized that he had been given the gift to draw from that same brilliant, Golden Light he had encountered in his journey.  This healing Light brings spectrums that enliven the body&amp;#65533;s natural physical and emotional healing process. In the simple &amp;#65533;non-touch&amp;#65533; sessions, a process of healing begins through the increased coherence and integration generated by the spectrums.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Tiffany Snow</title>
    <date>2004-10-09</date>
    <subtitle>Struck by lightening which produced a profound NDE, Tiffany Snow discovered she had been gifted with healing ability.  Now, as Author of two books, Tiffany continues her healing work as a Reiki practioner in CA.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;"Healing Prayer, Medical Intuitiveness and Hands-on Healing combined with the Near-Death Experience of a Lightning Strike, make Tiffany Snow unique and very powerful in the world of healers. Be prepared to be amazed." - L. Adams, Ph.D
&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Tiffany was born in Vista, California.  As a child, Tiffany was in touch with the other side, but learned to deny her abilities in order to "fit in." She grew up as an only child, traveling the back roads of the "American Dream" in a motor-home. During that time, Tiffany started writing, playing instruments and painting.  When she grew up, she settled in Nashville, TN, where she went on to produce instrumental and country albums, tour extensively, and receive standing ovations at the Grand &amp;#65533;Ol Opry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She came off the road shortly before the lightning strike which changed her life forever. Her near-death story is on the Chicago IANDS web site under "NDE Stories."  Coming full circle, Tiffany now lives back in Southern California with her family and the sea, where she continues to work as a healer and author.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tiffany practices what she calls "Divine Healing;"a powerful and often miraculous place of literal God-Connection where she lifts the client's physical, emotional and spiritual illnesses up through silent prayer and hands-on-healing to the Presence of God,  accessing and utilizing the same gift she first experienced in heaven during her NDE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

She is a dynamic speaker, and has received excellent reviews from such varied groups as IANDS, Edgar Cayce&amp;#65533;s ARE, Barnes &amp; Noble and Kiwanis.  She is a full time Healer and currently works in several clinical locations. She teaches monthly classes on Personal Growth, Healing, and Psychic Phenomena / Intuitive Abilities.  She has gives workshops across the country and is currently doing a series for The Learning Annex in Los Angeles and San Diego, CA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tiffany Snow has  a  Doctorate of Divinity from World Christianship Ministries and  a Masters of Theology from Suffield University.  She is a Licensed CE Provider for the California Board of Registered Nursing (Governed by the State of California Dept. of Consumer Affairs), a Licensed Theocentric Healer by the Commission on Religious Counseling and Healing, a Member of the International Holistic Healing Circle &amp; Society, a Missionary Pastor at Corner Stone Christian Fellowship, and a Usui Reiki Master Practitioner, 4th Degree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tiffany has authored two books, &lt;i&gt;Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life:  Tools to Connect,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Power of the Divine:  A Healer's Guide,&lt;/i&gt; and has had articles published in several magazines, including &lt;i&gt;Holistic Health&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Healing Path. Two more books are scheduled to be released within the next two years.&lt;/i&gt; She has been filmed for a TV documentary on NDES to be aired through Campus Crusade in 125 countries.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Sonia Choquette</title>
    <date>2004-12-11</date>
    <subtitle>Spiritual Teacher, Intuitive, Author, talks about her NDE and other spiritual experiences.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Sonia Choquette is a world-renowned psychic, intuitive and spiritual teacher who specializes in helping others recognize that we are all endowed with a sixth sense that we can count on and need to activate in order to succeed in our lives.   Blessed with a gift for presenting spiritual material in an easily unstandable package, Sonia draws upon many up-lifting stories from her life experiences to illustrate the lessons which she so successfully teaches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A masterful guide committed to strengthening intuition in our daily lives, she is the best-selling author of seven books: &lt;i&gt;The Psychic Pathway&lt;/i&gt; (Three Rivers Press), &lt;i&gt;Your Heart's Desire&lt;/i&gt; (Three Rivers Press), &lt;i&gt;The Wise Child&lt;/i&gt; (Three Rivers Press), &lt;i&gt;True Balance&lt;/i&gt; (Three Rivers Press), &lt;i&gt;Your Psychic Pathway to New Beginnings&lt;/i&gt; (Clarkson Potter/ Publishers, July 2002), &lt;i&gt;Your Psychic Pathway to Joy&lt;/i&gt; (Clarkson Potter Publishers, July 2002), &lt;i&gt;The Diary of a Psychic&lt;/i&gt; (Hay House/Publishers July 2003), and numerous audio editions.  Her bestselling books have been published in more than 23 countries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Highly trained in the Psychic Arts and Metaphysical Law, with extensive background in the mysticism of East and West, Sonia was educated at the University of Denver and at the Sorbonne in Paris, and holds a Ph.D. in Metaphysics from the American Institute of Holistic Theology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sonia says, "I am intuitive because I was encouraged at all times to be awake, aware and guided by my sixth sense. I grew up in an environment that treated intuition not only as natural but actually essential to successful navigation in life. Intuition is a gift that we all have, that we can all experience, that we can all trust and that we all need!"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In working with people for more than 32 years of almost daily one-on-one private consultations, Sonia insists that the sixth sense is natural to us all. Whether it's those "hunches" or "feelings" or "vibes", everyone has them, but unfortunately most people dismiss or ignore them and sadly miss the benefits. With the onset of the changing world we now live in, Sonia emphasizes that using our intuition is "no longer optional. Working with and strengthening our intuition is becoming more and more fundamental to our ability to live harmoniously with ourselves and others in the new world order."  Sonia also speaks and conducts workshops around the globe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sonia has been a guest on ABC, NBC, CNN, The Wisdom Channel, and WGN as well as featured in New Woman Magazine (where they rated &lt;i&gt;Your Heart's Desire&lt;/i&gt; as one of the 10 best courses to change your life), New Age Magazine, USA Today, Body, Mind and Soul, Chicago Tribune, and Crain's Chicago Business Journal. She has also been a personal psychic advisor to such New Age Leaders as Louise Hay, Dr. Wayne Dyer, pop icon Billy Corgan of the former Smashing Pumpkins rock band and present, Zwan, and psychic consultant to international business leaders such as Charlotte Beers, Advertising CEO and former head of the Campaign for America, appointed by President Bush.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sonia lives in Chicago with husband Patrick Tully, daughters Sonia and Sabrina, and a poodle named Miss T.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Adrienne Z. Shaps, J.D.C.B.T., had a near-death experience in 1977,  which put her on a spiritual path as a healer.    She has been clairvoyant since childhood and many forms of healing had been revealed to her before and after her near-death experience.   She works with people, animals (dogs, cats and horses) and plants with "Bodytalk," incorporating other modalities before or after Bodytalk. She seeks to balance the energies of all living things.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
She has studied Bodytalk, dna Possibilities, Himalayan Bowl Healing, PsycheOrientology, Atlantean Crystal Healing Bed Sessions, and Hands On Healing---and has completed courses with Jose and Tony Silva, Richard Rudis, Margaret Ruby and John and Esther Veltheim.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Judy Goodman</title>
    <date>2005-03-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, Intuitive and Spiritual Teacher from Atlanta, GA</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Internationally recognized speaker, Judy Goodman, is possibly one of the most gifted spiritual teachers in the world today.  Her access to the workings of the physical world and of &amp;#65533;the other side&amp;#65533; is profound.  She is fully clairvoyant.   Judy has been through major surgery seven times, been struck by lightning and had a near-death experience (NDE).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In Judy's own words:
"For me, embracing death during a NDE was like stepping through the mirror of time and remembering what my life is all about.  All of my life I have walked in both worlds and worked to unlock other people&amp;#65533;s awareness of what their journey is all about.  During those seven minutes, as I walked in a place where time does not exist, my level of peace was renewed; my knowledge was strengthened; my resolve to release others from their fear of death became more resolute; during this time I experienced incredible things and remembered &amp;#65533;home.&amp;#65533;"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Judy has been featured on radio and television; her work is the subject of an award-winning book and she was recently featured on the SciFi channel, &lt;i&gt;In Search Of.&lt;/i&gt;  Judy is a &amp;#65533;teacher of teachers&amp;#65533; and her ability to teach at every level is limited only by the ability of the student to grasp the knowledge.  She is author of 'Journey, the Quest of the Soul' and 'Death, Our Journey of Life' and is a faculty member of the Kaiser Institute of Denver, Colorado.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;tt&gt; In my business career, I have had the benefit of hearing some truly charismatic speakers, such as Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, Tony Robbins, etc.   And   then, I heard Judy Goodman speak.   Not only did she speak without a single note for three days&amp;#65533; classes and seminars, she never lost the attention of the audience.  We were all captivated by her message and her intuitive ability to zero in on each of our &amp;#65533;needy spots.&amp;#65533;  I rank Judy among the very finest seminar leaders and speakers in the country today, and her message is always enlightening and on target!&lt;/i&gt;  S. Burden, Business Executive - Atlanta, GA

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I think I did my best two hours of radio although I had no frame of reference for someone who says, "You can ask me about anything," I now at least appreciate the honesty of that remark.  I have never, and may not ever again interview someone with whom there are no boundaries.&lt;/i&gt;Radio Talk Show Host

    <body>&lt;p&gt;
In March 1999,  Roby Rogers, M.D., had a Near-Death Experience which changed the way she looked at death and dying and the role of disease in a person's life.  It also changed the way she practices medicine and influenced her in many other ways, which will be the focus of her talk.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Sharon Heller</title>
    <date>2005-06-11</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, now from Austin, TX, blossomed into Waldorf teacher and Brain Gym&amp;AElig; Instructor after her NDE</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Sharon Heller had a profound 3-day Near-Death Experience in the fall of 1977 which dramatically changed her life. Having already travelled a spiritual path for years and having lived an remote existence in the Rocky Mountain "wilderness" prior to her NDE, Sharon was re-directed to be much more involved, purposeful, and of service in the practical day-to-day world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharon journeyed to Detroit, Michigan, to complete a B.A. and become a certified Waldorf teacher. She taught pre-kindergarten through 10th grade and has been a mentor/consultant to public, private and charter schools.  She became a licensed Brain Gym&amp;AElig; Instructor in 1987 and a full-time practitioner in 1991, serving countless people in that capacity. In 1991 she also co-founded and coordinated Austin IANDS. Sharon still lives in Austin, Texas, where, recently (at age 54) she obtained an M.S. in Community Health Administration and Wellness Promotion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In all she does, Sharon uses her intuition and brings the knowledge of Love, Light and Wisdom she experienced on "the other side" to her work and play. She considers herself a "life artist" and her purpose to assist others to understand how to live each life as a precious gift of God.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Sharon Heller will be doing private sessions on Sunday and Monday, following her talk.  Using her considerable intuitive gifts to guide her sessions, Sharon instructs individuals in physical movements which enhance learning and performance in all areas. The NDEr and the spiritual aspirant will especially appreciate this program, which is a modern-day path to mind/body/spirit integration.  This method is also valuable for those with physical, mental and/or emotional challenges.  $85/hr.  To sign up, call Chicago IANDS: 847.251.5758 or email:

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Thomas Gates</title>
    <date>2005-08-13</date>
    <subtitle>Back by popular demand!   Healer, known for successful group  and individual healings, will tell about his NDE and do an extensive group healing.   </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Gates was born in Texas in 1950 and was the fourth of five children. He grew up in the rural countryside not far from Dallas, where he and his brothers and sisters attended Catholic school. His father was a fireman, and his loving mother was a homemaker and the quiet spiritual leader of the family. At the age of twelve he began working as a professional musician and soon became an accomplished drummer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
He spent much of his childhood playing in the woods, observing the stars, the sky, the trees, the animals, the changing of seasons, and the effortless flow of nature&amp;#65533;s way. As a result he sensed that there must be one simple and powerful essence sustaining all this incredibly diverse creation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Then, shortly before his twenty-second birthday, Thomas learned Transcendental Meditation. This brought the experience of the underlying wholeness of all creation and confirmed his sense of what had been occurring in nature all along. This euphoria lasted about one week when he suddenly found himself being rushed to the hospital with a case of appendicitis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Thomas found himself in what appeared to be a losing battle for his life. Soon after the surgery, he heard the doctors announce to his father, "We're sorry. We've done everything we can. You should know that he might not mike it." Within moments Thomas began an amazing and graceful journey all the way through and beyond the "light" to the underlying, eternal source of his own existence and that of all creation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
As the universe began to unfold before him, he experienced and understood many things about our creation. He encountered a magnificent golden light and was completely absorbed by its powerful, healing warmth. The greatest gift was the confirmation that we are all eternal and inseparable from our source, from one another, or from any other particle of the universe. This experience forever changed his perception and understanding of life as he began a new journey back into the realm of human existence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
As he began to share his story with others, walking them through the journey, Thomas became aware that there appeared to be some subtle healing value experienced by those with whom he shared. It seems to bring a greater sense of peace and increasing freedom from some underlying fears without specifically addressing any particular fears. Fear is an illusion created by the belief and the resulting experience that we are separate from the source of our whole ness and its presence in all points of creation. With the spontaneous collapse of fear more wholeness is revealed. This can bring into our lives more than just the memory of who we really are but, in fact, the experience of who we really are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Thomas was given the gift to draw from that same brilliant, golden light he had encountered in his journey which brings spectrums that enliven the body&amp;#65533;s natural physical and emotional healing process. The spectrums not only facilitate pain relief but also help release the underlying remnants of trauma in the physiology that give rise to physical and emotional dysfunction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
"Thomas Gates is an exceptional speaker with an extraordinary message. The story of his profound near-death experience conveys a deep sense of peace and an understanding of the eternal connection that we all have to one another." --Loni Parrott, Founder and Facilitator, Iowa City, IA IANDS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
"I had just hurt my ankle and was limping badly when I had a session with Thomas. I immediately began to feel heat in the ankle and then a soothing coolness as the pain disappeared. After the session I stood up and walked without any pain whatsoever. I never had a problem with it again." --MM, Fairfield, IA, Consultant

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Mellen-Thomas Benedict</title>
    <date>2005-10-08</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr from CA, will talk about his extensive experience on the other side and will focus on the practical application of the information received.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
After suffering from a terminal illness, in 1982 Mellen-Thomas &amp;#65533;died&amp;#65533; and for an hour and a half he was monitored showing no vital signs.  Miraculously he returned to his body with a complete remission of the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While on the &amp;#65533;other side&amp;#65533; Mellen journeyed through several realms of consciousness and beyond the &amp;#65533;light at the end of the tunnel&amp;#65533;.  He was shown, in holographic detail, Earth&amp;#65533;s past and a beautiful vision of mankind&amp;#65533;s future for the next 400 years.  He experienced the cosmology of our soul&amp;#65533;s connection to mother earth (Gaia), our role in the Universe, and was gifted with access to Universal Intelligence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since his near-death experience, Mellen-Thomas has maintained his direct access to Universal Intelligence, and returns to the light at will, enabling him to be a bridge between science and spirit.  He has been involved in research programs and has developed new technologies for health and wellness.  With humility, insight, and depth of feeling he shares his experience and insights.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He brings back with him a message of hope and inspiration for humanity, delivered with a joy and clarity that is refreshing.  His depth of feeling and passion for life is a gift to be shared.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The following are quotes from experts in the field of near-death research:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#65533;Mellen is able, while in trance, to see into microcosmic structures.  although he maintains awareness in a hyper-alert state, it is clear that he is able to simultaneously span several octaves of consciousness, from which he can acquire biological information that is extraordinary.&amp;#65533;
---Lee Pulos, Ph.D., Author of &amp;#65533;Miracles and Other Realities,&amp;#65533; Former President of the Canadian Society of Clinical Hypnosis and Senior Psychologist to the Olympic Team Canada.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#65533;Mellen-Thomas has the big picture.&amp;#65533;
&amp;#65533;His story is one of the most remarkable I have encountered in extensive research on near-death experiences.  It is very rare that those who have died and returned have seen into the future to the extent that Mellen has.  His vision of the future is one of hope.  He has participated in studies of a Major University, where he contributed to understanding the structure of genes and chromosome coding for a genetic disease, while researchers puzzled over how he could have access to this information.&amp;#65533;
---Dr. Kenneth Ring, Author of &amp;#65533;Heading Toward Omega; The Omega Project&amp;#65533;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#65533;The near-death experience of Mellen-Thomas is the only one I have yet come across where an individual willfully changed the episode&amp;#65533;s scenario as it was actually happening.  what impresses me the most about Mellen-Thomas is that he dedicated many years, not only to understanding the phenomenon&amp;#65533;s after effects, but to controlling and training his newly expended psychic faculties.  by opting for discipline instead of notoriety, and keeping himself firmly grounded in the practicality of patented invention, he is now emerging as a clear and steady voice&amp;#65533; a solution finder&amp;#65533;  ready to tackle the most vexing problems of the global community.&amp;#65533;
---P.M.H. Atwater, Researcher and Author of &amp;#65533;Beyond the Light,&amp;#65533; in which Mellen&amp;#65533;s advanced skills are discussed.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Dr. Allan Botkin, Psy.D.</title>
    <date>2005-11-12</date>
    <subtitle>Clinical Psychologist and after-death researcher discusses powerful treatment which releases patients from grief.   Author of
"Induced After-death Communication: A New Therapy for Healing Grief And Trauma"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Over the last fifteen years Dr. Botkin has been experimenting with variations of a new and very powerful psychological procedure called eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). He discovered that one variation of this procedure results in an experience that nearly all patients believe is actual communication with the deceased---regardless of their prior beliefs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a new, cutting edge technique in which a near-death-like state is induced which allows someone who is grieving to meet with the deceased on the other side and have an interactive conversation which heals their grief.  This process can take as little as 10 minutes and can sometimes heal the grief of those who have been in therapy for years.  As of today, Dr Botkin and his colleagues have induced well over 3000 ADCs (After Death Communications).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Allan Botkin  has been a practicing psychologist since 1983.  He recently retired from being a clinical psychologist at the VA Medical Center in North Chicago, Illinois, where he developed the Intensive Trauma Program (ITP), which preliminary studies indicate is one of the most effective in the country.1  He is now  devoting his energy to his private practice in Libertyville, IL, and to speaking on this subject throughout the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Botkin&amp;#65533;s expertise in his specialty has long been respected by the psychotherapeutic community, as indicated by the publication of &amp;#65533;Case studies of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder&amp;#65533; in the journal, &lt;i&gt;Psychotherapy, &lt;/i&gt;by Lipke and Botkin (1992). His most recent article &amp;#65533;The Induction of After-Death Communications Utilizing Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing: A New Discovery,&amp;#65533; appeared in the&lt;i&gt; Journal of Near-Death Studies,
&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 18, No. 3, Spring 2000.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He holds a Psy.D in clinical psychology from Baylor University, an M.A. in clinical psychology from Illinois State University, and a B.A. in psychology from the University of Kansas. His new book has just been released--- &lt;i&gt; Induced After-Death Communication:
A New Therapy for Healing Grief and Trauma . &lt;/i&gt; He has been on Art Bell and other shows and is a popular and powerful speaker on the subject of ADC's.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;
1&amp;#65533;The Intensive Trauma Program (ITP) at the North Chicago VA Medical Center: A New Approach to the Treatment of Traumatic memories&amp;#65533; presented at the PTSD Outcomes Symposium at Hines VA Medical Center, Hines, Illinois, September 1998 by Botkin, et al.

    <date>2005-12-10</date>
    <subtitle>Spend the afternoon with one of the most celebrated NDErs in the world.  A great opportunity!</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;

Dannion Brinkley is an international best selling author. He has recently written the third installment drawing from his personal voyage and near-death encounters entitled, The Secrets of the Light, (Heartland Productions), an intuitively profound manual that focuses on spiritual strategies to empower your daily life, and in the eternal framework.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Co-authored with his wife, Kathryn, The Secrets of the Light focuses on 7 powerful truths that will compel you to re-evaluate and re-connect through awareness and understanding for self-realization and ultimately spiritual enfoldment. The guide book introduces the Four-Fold Path to Power, and shares the system that you may have not previously considered as a truly effective means to raise one's consciousness and its relationship with humankind. Inspiring and thought-provoking, The Secrets of the Light offers insightful application, and a key to understanding the big picture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In his lectures and tours, Dannion imparts a paramount message designed to empower his listeners, teaching them step by step how to find purpose, power and greatness in their lives. He has been praised as 'the best orator in the field' by many of his compeers on the lecture circuit. Dannion's speaking engagements lend a vibrancy and colorful approach about the world as we know it, and highlighted with a savvy sense of humor and genuine style. The Secrets of the Light lecture series offer a candid, celebratory approach of the spiritual dynamic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Brinkley's previous works, Saved By The Light and At Peace In The Light, have sold millions worldwide, garnering international acclaim in addition to being a New York Times best seller. His books, tours and workshops have literally transformed the consciousness of audiences on a global capacity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dannion's expertise in the area of death and dying has educated millions not to fear the presently held concept of dying. As a result of his journeys to the 'other side' and back again, he brings to the forefront the wondrous truth that there is indeed no such thing as death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dannion has survived insurmountable odds including two lightning strikes, open-heart surgery, brain surgery and a massive grand mal seizure. Many concur that Mr. Brinkley is a "walking miracle"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In related issues surrounding the death process, Brinkley is one of the early crusaders of hospice and palliative care bringing the topic of end of life care to the forefront of discussion and education in America. Dannion created a non-profit organization, The Twilight Brigade (Compassion in action) to recruit hospice volunteers for dying Veterans. He has been a hospice volunteer for over twenty-four years, having personally accrued more than 10,000 hours at the bedside. These years of tremendous hands-on experience qualify him as a leading expert in the grief and bereavement process as well as being an authority in the field of necrophobic reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2001, Dannion was nominated for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Association's prestigious Heart of Hospice Award. Dannion was also a contributor in the story compilation of Chicken Soup for the Veteran's Soul. His input was used to improve awareness of the honor of veteran service. Compassion in Action / The Twilight Brigade was featured in the December 2000 issue of The Oprah Magazine segment on Volunteerism. In 2004, Dannion provided testimony, "Describing Death in America" to the National Cancer Advisory Board of the Institute of Medicine and presented comment to the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Policy, on "Improving End of Life care with Complementary and Alternative Medicines" and "You Cannot Drug A Child to Safety: Ways of Reducing Stress in America."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dannion has appeared on every major national television and radio show, including Larry King, Oprah, Dateline, Unsolved Mysteries, Art Bell, The Pax Network, and many others. A made for television movie based on Dannion's best seller, Saved By The Light, debuted as one of the highest rated television movies in FOX Television Network history. This exceptional movie starring Eric Roberts is currently airing on a regular basis on the Lifetime Network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When not on tour, Dannion enjoys his time spent at home with his wife, Kathryn, and their six children. Life with his twin soul, five girls and one boy afford him the luxury of witnessing the transformational transactions of true love and spirituality in action.

    <date>2006-01-14</date>
    <subtitle>Asso. Prof of History (U of IL-Chicago), Author,  will speak about his near-death experience, his miraculous healing, and how his life has changed.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;After a serious accident, Steve Fanning spent two weeks in a coma that left him paralyzed in 1988.  Once he returned to consciousness, he was miraculously healed and learned to walk, despite his doctor's prognosis that his walking was neurologically impossible.  During his coma, Steve had a near-death experience through which it was revealed that he had to rearrange his life.  From that point on, he began listening to his conscience, ignoring his ego, and started studying mysticism, which resulted in an excellent book:  Mystics of the Christian Tradition (New York and London: Routledge, 2001).  Steve will discuss his NDE and Life Review and focus on the impact that it made upon him.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
Steve Fanning received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in History from Texas Tech University and his Ph.D. in History from the University of Minnesota.  He was Assistant Dean in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, from 1996-1999 and a member of the Department of History there since 1980.  Before that he was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of History at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and the University of Minnesota.
Beside the book previously mentioned, he also wrote:  A Bishop and His World Before the Gregorian Reform, Hubert of Angers, 1006-1047 (Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 78, Part I, 1988).  He has published many articles in magazines, journals and encyclopedias and has received many grants and awards for his work.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Richard Sandore, M.D.</title>
    <date>2006-03-11</date>
    <subtitle>Shamans, Hallucinogens and the NDE</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;From Time Magazine:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Doctor Richard Sandore is an author, teacher, mentor, and physician who embarked on a journey out of the ordinary and commonplace after having a profound spiritual experience in the  early nineties which confirmed for him the world we live in is not what we have been lead to believe it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He now has multiple pursuits including writing, education, and corporate seminars as well as working with individuals who seek to change their lives by stepping into radical spiritual experiences.  His knowledge of many worlds - medicine, world spiritualities, education, healing, and business - allow him to function as a conduit between where his clients are and where they desire to be. &lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Sandore will discuss how native peoples have used medicinal plants from time immemorial to induce visions, to heal, and to explore the territory of consciousness we call death.  Ayahuasca, a jungle vine whose name means "Vine of the Soul" or "Vine of Death", is used by shamans to "take one to death and back."  Some say that once the threshold of death is explored and the fear of death relinquished, we are truly free to be claimed by life. The art of many regions of the Amazon basin has been influenced by visions induced through a journey with Grandmother Ayahuasca.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Richard Sandore is a Western-trained physician who practiced obstetrics and gynecology for nine years.  During that time he began working with native healers in South America.  Their encompassing worldview and concepts of healing changed his life.  Dr. Sandore is a recognized expert in the field of complementary healing, and until recently had a healing practice north of Chicago.  He is now based in California and lectures, teaches, and leads groups to work with spiritual healers in South America, and has been the featured speaker at numerous conferences, including the Whole Life Expo and the National Wellness Conference.  He also is a regular speaker at midwestern colleges, including Illinois Wesleyan University, and is the author of Living the Steps to Vibrancy and numerous other works.  Currently Dr Sandore spends the majority of his time working with spiritual seekers who desire intensive, in-depth training.  He also is in the process of writing his fourth novel.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  PMH Atwater, L.H.D., honorary Ph.D.</title>
    <date>2006-05-13</date>
    <subtitle>"The Secrets in My Soul"  For the first time!  World reknown researcher, intuitive, speaker, speaks about her 3 NDEs and the revelations she has been given.  Author of many books.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;

Born in Twin Falls, Idaho, Atwater married young and became a mother of three, Sunday School teacher, secretary, and prize winning cook. A handwriting analysis in the mid-sixties led to a complete career and life-style change. She was redirected into public service and innovative project development and analysis. Paralleling this change she began intensive research into paranormal and altered states of consciousness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With a professional background in hypnotic past-life regressions, sensitivity work, dehaunting houses, and mediumship, she came to specialize in aura massage, astrology, numerology, dream and symbol interpretation, rune casting, divinatory and earth energy sensing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1977 set the stage for severe health traumas resulting in death and the near-death phenomenon, three times in three months. The following year, in an effort to understand what had happened to her and was still happening, she began to seek out and interview other near-death survivors. Her initial findings about the aftereffects of near-death were published in Vital Signs magazine, 1981-85, and later became "COMING BACK TO LIFE: THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE" (hardcover 1988 Dodd Mead &amp; Co., paperback 1989 Ballantine Books, softcover,
Citadel Press). After over fifteen years of intensive research, speaking with or interviewing over 3,000 near-death survivors, her book "BEYOND THE LIGHT, WHAT ISN'T BElNG SAlD ABOUT THE NEAR-DEATH EXPERlENCE" (hard cover 1994 Birch Lane Press, paperback 1995 Avon Books) represents the most complete compendium yet done of the phenomenon, its aftereffects and implications (Its sequel: "FUTURE MEMORY," Birch Lane Press 1996, paperback edition from Hampton Roads Publishing).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An international authority on near-death states, she has served two terms on the Board of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. Her book, "CHILDREN OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM," a major study of child experiencers of near-death states, came out August 1999 from Three Rivers Press. It was then enlarged and rewritten as THE NEW CHILDREN AND NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES (Inner Traditions/Bear &amp; Co., 2003). With the help of David Morgan, she produced the world's first positive/negative, 360-degree compendium of the entire near-death phenomenon. Titled "THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCES," this 480-page Macmillan edition debuted March/April, 2000. Atwater has received numerous awards during her life. Her biography is in sixteen Who's Who Books, half of them international editions. Her latest book is BEYOND THE INDIGO CHILDREN: The New Children and the Coming of the Fifth World.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some of her findings have now been clinically verified in prospective studies, the latest in "The Lancet" medical journal 12-15-01, in the paper by Pim van Lommel, a Dutch cardiologist. She has lectured twice at the United Nations and at many other gatherings, large and small. Her writings have appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers. She has been on such television talk shows as Sally Jessy Raphael, Larry King Live, Entertainment Tonight, Regis &amp; Kathy Lee, Geraldo, and The Shirley Show in Canada.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An accomplished rune caster specializing in the yin or feminine approach to rune use, she authored "THE MAGICAL LANGUAGE OF RUNES," (1990 Bear &amp; Co.) and "GODDESS RUNES" (1996 Avon Books). Her talent with Goddess Runes was featured on the first two television infommercials produced by Psychic Friends Network. She has produced 'Goddess Runes: Instructions in Brief,' and 'Goddess Runes: The Adventure Begins,' An interview with her is now available on VHS video entitled 'Beyond the Light;' she has remastered her original tape 'As You Die' - in May, 2004, it will be available in four formats (CD, audio cassette, VHS video, and DVD) through Focus Worldwide. She attended Boise State University, Boise, Idaho, and received her humanities doctorate in 1992 from the International College of Spiritual and Psychic Studies (Spiritual Sciences Fellowship), Montreal, Canada. In March, 2005, P. M. H. Atwater, L.H.D. was awarded an Honorary Ph.D. in Therapeutic Counseling from Faculty of Medical Studies, Medicina Alternativa Institute, affiliated with The Open International University for Complementary Medicines, Colombo, Sri Lanka. And in the fall of 2005 she was awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the National Association of Transpersonal Hypnotherapists and the "Outstanding Service Award" from the International Association of Near-Death Studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
Private one hour rune casting sessions are available on Sunday and Monday, May 14 &amp; 15.  Call 847.251.5758 for info and appt.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Deana Chase-Moore</title>
    <date>2006-06-10</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, massage therapist, intuitive shares her wonderful and amazing experiences....</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Deanna Chase-Moore was born in Missouri just before World War II.  Her family soon moved and she grew up in California&amp;#65533;s Bay Area.  During her early childhood, she had unusual experiences which were unexplainable for any three or four year old.  The explanation took nearly thirty years to reveal itself, but this became a window to her life&amp;#65533;s work as a touch therapist.  Two Near-Death Experiences revealed to Deana the truths of energy and how you view a different perspective of relationships, health and religion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deanna's story is one of the most intense and funny stories, about a child who didn't want to touch or be touched by other people, who became a massage therapist whose touch would reveal to her the past-lives of those she massaged.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A warm, delightful person who is fully intuitive, Ms. Moore will be doing private reflexology sessions on Sun and Mon, June 11 and 12.  Call 847.251.5758 for an appointment and get in touch with your past lives!

    <subtitle>NDEr, "Living Roots Connection", Spiritual Teacher and Intuitive from Seattle area.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Sharon Gray Lester is nationally respected for her gifts as a spiritual teacher and intuitive.  She began developing her method of healing work (&lt;i&gt;The Living Roots Connection&lt;/i&gt;) sixteen years ago after her Near-Death Experience and her own healing of cancer.  During this time she was shown NON-LINEAR INFORMATIONAL PATTERNS OF SACRED KNOWLEDGE.  As a result, she was guided to develop &lt;i&gt;The Living Roots Connection&lt;/i&gt; which utilizes the ENERGY AND WISDOM OF NATURE TO HEAL; cultivating within people and our earth a new strength, joy, and peacefulness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Throughout the last sixteen years, Sharon's foundation of understanding has been deepened by working with gifted healers and indigenous peoples who carry the knowledge of the roots of civilization.  Her gifts help people to learn how to entrain to Nature to inform and vitalize their health on every level.  Authentic change is created easily without a resulting dependency on the practitioner.  Sharon's devotion in service is to teach tools and bring forth a vibration which helps people to bring to their lives sustainable inner resources and the wisdom of their own spirit.  She believes that this awakening is more than personal growth; it is a key factor for PLANETARY SUSTAINABILITY and healing of our Earth.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My history with the Angels began at the age of eighteen months, when I had a near-death experience. Flashing white objects appeared close to the ceiling and I knew I would be saved. I later learned that those flying white objects were Angels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Years later, I heard a booming voice call out, 'Sue, you have to help people!' My reply was 'Yes, God what do you want me to do?'
Following the Divine Plan, the Angels have kept me very busy since then---doing interviews, lectures, seminars, writing and counseling. "

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Bill Torvund</title>
    <date>2006-12-09</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, founder of Sanctuary of the On, Healer</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Bill Torvund's first experienced his healing gifts at the age of three. He began his professional healing career at 18 and at the age of 22 was ordained into the healing ministry. He then served as associate pastor at Grace Bible Church and the Friendly Chapel in Portland, Oregon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He began his private healing practice in 1978 and in 1980, incorporated the Sanctuary of the On -- a religious non-profit that provides the organizational structure for the spiritual, educational and outreach functions of his healing ministry. In 1990, he was invested as the Abbot Provincial General of the Order of the Sacred Parousia (the appearance that Jesus will make at the consummation of the Aeon ), which is the religious Presentist order that Abbot Torvund uses to initiate and ordain clergypersons to the healing ministry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In over thirty years of practice as an accomplished clinical intuitive and spiritual healer, he has administered by the empowerment of the Holy Spirit over one million healings to approximately 100,000 people from more than twenty-five countries in North America, South America, Europe, Scandinavia and Asia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

MORE ABOUT BILL TORVUND - THE HEALER
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    Bill Torvund was born October 29, 1951, in Great Falls, Montana. His family relocated to the South in 1952 where in 1954 at the age of three, his spiritual/angelic experiences began. While praying in his back yard, the sky directly above his house was suddenly filled with a brilliant orb of light, which was also observed by neighbors for many hours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Leaving the South for California in 1958, he developed a serious medical condition from which he was not expected to survive. Deteriorating to a near-death experience from which he miraculously recovered, his inner angelic light body further developed his sensitivity to the angelic realms.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He began his first public ministry at the Indian Hill Church of Christ in 1962, where he taught adult bible class and gave sermons. All during this time, he began his study of the classical sacred languages and sacred traditions, which continues today. While in junior and senior high school, he was involved with the development of religious study classes and course curricula, and began his paracollegiate studies and teaching assistantships in these areas on a continuing basis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Moving with his family to Duluth, Minnesota, in the summer of 1969, he began studying spiritual healing with the First Spiritualist Church of Duluth and conducted his first public healing service on February 8, 1970. It was at this point that people began to request his services as a healer, which he continued when he moved to Portland, Oregon in the fall of that year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He began his active pastoral career in Portland, Oregon through Grace Bible Church and the Prince of Peace Chapel in 1970-72, and also served as an assistant chaplain for the returning Vietnam veterans. In 1972 he became an adjunct lecturer in parapsychology through Southern Oregon State College in Ashland, Oregon, and then later had a similar position in Pocatello, Idaho in coordination with Idaho State University in the spring of 1975. It was also in Pocatello, Idaho that Abbot Torvund established an affiliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, becoming a cantor and assisting the priest in the realization of the Divine Liturgy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Returning to Portland, Oregon in the fall of 1977, he became the coordinator of the holistic/spiritual healing facility of the Atlantis Rising Educational Center until the fall of 1979. He then entered into full-time spiritual healing practice, establishing his resident healing ministry in Seattle, Washington, in the winter of 1979.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Abbot Torvund founded the Sanctuary of the On in February 1980 and began to expand his healing and teaching ministry, establishing one of the largest spiritual healing practices in the United States. Students and clients came from all over the world and, as a result of the many requests received for healing in other areas, embarked on a world healing tour from 1987-1989.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since 1989, he has been most active in his healing activities in the following cities; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco, California; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York City, New York; Sedona, Arizona'; and Atlanta, Georgia
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From such diverse places in the world as the slums of Manila to the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., thousands of people have been graced by the Holy Spirit through his ministry from all walks of life &amp;#65533; including some of the most eminent spiritual masters and political leaders of this century.

    <subtitle>Past-Life Parents:  Amazing stories of reincarnation, including one in the same family, which was featured in Carol Bowman's book, Return From Heaven.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most exciting meetings we will ever have.  Three parents will be telling the stories of their children's past-life memories.   "Knock your socks off" stuff.  Don't miss this one!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Some very young children remember their previous lives and deaths spontaneously, without prompting or hypnosis. It is a natural phenomenon that has profound implications for parents as well as anyone curious to know what happens after death.  Billy Luke, Liza Kobernik, and Mary Flemming will share heartwarming stories of their own children's past lives, which will make reincarnation real and personal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cases of reincarnation within the same family, which is a surprisingly common, yet unpublicized phenomenon, is the subject of Carol Bowman's book, Return from Heaven.  This book features the story of Billy Luke's son, Chad, who was born to his wife two times.  His story is amazing, and will give you a chance to reevaluate your own relatives. Mary Flemming will also share breathtaking stories of her children.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you suspect that a child in your family shows signs of a past life, bring your own story to share.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker: Asia Voight</title>
    <date>2007-02-10</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, Gifted Animal Communicator,died 4 times</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In December of 1987, Asia Voight was in a life-threatening car accident which resulted when a semitrailer ran into her van. She was trapped inside as a wall of fire burned all around her. Miraculously she survived. She spent three months in the Intensive Care Unit, and another nine months in the hospital. Asia had 4 death experiences. Two of them she remembers clearly and will be sharing with you. She will also talk about the results of her experiences and how she came to talk to animals. Asia comments, "I have really used this horrific accident as an opportunity to see the world from a spiritual perspective. It has opened my eyes to a new level of love."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the car accident, Asia was awakened to reconnect with her inborn ability to communicate with animals. She began her professional work in August 1998 after studying advanced levels of animal communication with Penelope Smith. She has enjoyed working with over 4000 animals and also teaches workshops in animal communication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Asia's work has been featured on television, in magazines, and in Dr. Julie Kaufmans's book, Crossing the Rubicon: Celebration of the Human-Animal Bond in Life and Death. Asia has also appeared as a keynote speaker at the Midwest Horse Fair, Madison, WI, 2000, and at the Wellness Conference, Madison, WI, 2001. She earned a degree in Communication Arts from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. She has also worked as a midwife's assistant, cranial-sacral therapist, and healer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We hope you can join us to hear Asia tell her story and to continue sharing inspiration, information and support together.  Asia will also be giving private one-on-one sessions on the following Sunday and Monday. Call 847.251.5758 for an appointment.  $135/hour.  Don't miss this special opportunity.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Joyce Hawkes, Ph.D.</title>
    <date>2007-03-10</date>
    <subtitle>Bio-physicist, NDEr, Healer---from Seattle. </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
A passionate and productive scientist, student, mystic, teacher and healer, Dr Joyce Hawkes is internationally recognized for her work as a research scientist and her more recent work as a teacher of Cell-Level healing. Her early work on the biophysics of cell structure and function included a position as a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National Institutes of Health. She published nearly 50 papers, abstracts, and book chapters. The innovative excellence of her research earned her election to the position of Fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a position which she maintains presently.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;             Following a near-death experience she changed careers in 1984 and embarked on an extensive exploration of spiritual and healing traditions. Recognized on first sight by her indigenous teachers as authentically and exceptionally gifted, she was invited into the native cultures of healing wisdom by those who had not previously taken Western students. Nearly three months living in the Philippines and work with a native healer preceded her exploration of additional SE Asian healing practices. A month long stay in South India and six trips to Bali to work intensively with two native Hindu priest/shamans immersed her in Eastern philosophy, remote village life, and first-hand experience of numerous practical applications of indigenous healing modalities.
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;           With twenty two years experience working as a spiritual counselor, healer, and seminar leader in Seattle, in other US cities, and abroad, Joyce combines her rigorous background as a scientist and her compassion as a healer in her presentations and writing. Her book: &lt;i&gt;Cell-Level Healing. The Bridge from Soul to Cell (Oct 2006)&lt;/i&gt;
demonstrates effective ways to harmonize spirituality and Western science. A popular seminar leader and conference presenter, she has also appeared on radio: Coast to Coast in the US and Canada; on local, national, and international TV; and at major global conferences to speak about her insights and successful applications of Cell-Level healing for optimal health.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reviews of Joyce's new book: &lt;i&gt;Cell-Level Healing. The Bridge from Soul to Cell (Oct 2006)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Cell-Level Healing is a remarkable bridge between conventional cell biology and the far reaches of self and spiritual healing. Dr. Hawkes skillfully combines her solid scientific grounding and experience in mainstream biophysics with personal insights gained from a near death experience and extensive training in the alternative healing arts. Hawkes beautifully demonstrates how science and spirituality can peacefully coexist and inform each other in beneficial and refreshing ways.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212;Dean Radin PhD, Senior Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Cell-Level Healing is quite simply the whole exciting truth about how and why our consciousness is key to our physical health and well-being.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212;Christiane Northrup, M. D., author of Mother-Daughter Wisdom, The Wisdom of Menopause, and Women&amp;#8217;s Bodies, Women&amp;#8217;s Wisdom
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;A remarkable book. Cell-Level Healing provides the reader with a poetic and visual text on self-healing and demonstrates how science and spirituality need not be opponents but can serve as allies in the reader&amp;#8217;s transformation. Dr. Joyce Hawkes has created a delightful user-friendly volume that can be read, savored, and re-read&amp;#8212;one that is both simple and profound.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212;Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center; co-editor of Varieties of Anomalous Experience; and author of Extraordinary Dreams and How to Work with Them
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Science and spirit are brought together with beauty and discernment in this exquisite book. Joyce Hawkes offers us a vision of healing that truly manages to bridge worlds which only remain separate at our peril. &amp;#8216;The Bridge from Soul to Cell&amp;#8217; is more than a good metaphor: it links wisdom and science and by doing so opens the way for great healing.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212;James O&amp;#8217;Dea, president, Institute of Noetic Sciences
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Joyce Hawkes blends and makes whole our splintered perceptions of the roles of science and spirit in healing.  Her beautiful vision of how cells house the very power of the universe, speaks to a greater understanding and the interconnectedness of the spiritual in the physical.  In this broader understanding, Joyce bridges the gulf between the tangible and the intangible. She offers up the potential for self-healing, always waiting within us. Her book is both art and science for healing&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8212;Joan C. King, Ph. D., professor emerita at Tufts University School of Medicine, author of the Cellular Wisdom series
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;The intrinsic nature of our being is primordially pure, luminous awareness&amp;#8212;and mind and body are the unified expression of that reality. Dr. Hawkes&amp;#8217;s insightful work brings a depth of scientific knowledge together with the tools for applying that understanding in a way that relieves suffering and promotes spiritual awareness. Cell-Level Healing sheds welcome light on the interdependence of our inner and outer worlds. It provides practical guidance for working with the challenges of illness while supporting our journey of personal transformation.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Kimberly Clark Sharp, MSW</title>
    <date>2007-04-14</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, Author, Seattle's Near-Death Comedienne!</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;/p&gt;
Kimberly Clark Sharp, M.S.W., has earned the title of "Near-Death Comedienne" through her many presentations about near-death experiences.  She is the founder and president of the Seattle International Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS), the oldest and one of the largest groups of its kind in the world. A clinical social worker, Sharp has taught at the University of Washington School of Medicine and at Seattle University. She lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband and daughter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her book,&lt;i&gt; After the Light,&lt;/i&gt; is a near-death classic, educating thousands about the near-death experience with much humor and tact, delivering the serious message that we do not die in an irresistibly humorous package.  It is difficult to put her book down once you begin to read.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Death is nothing to fear - and life without fear can be lived to the fullest."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is Kimberly Clark Sharp's message from her extraordinary experience during the time after her heart suddenly stopped beating and she lay on the sidewalk, not breathing, and without a pulse. Swept into a peaceful loving place of brilliant golden light and warm comfort, she saw, for the first time, the meaning of life - and death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thereafter, Kimberly, with hamster Toto at her side, left Kansas for Seattle - known as "the Emerald City" -- to fulfill a destiny devoted to the service of others as foreseen at the end of her near-death experience. Guided by a new sensitivity to the presence of angels, demons and other invisibilities, Kimberly attained a Masters degree in Social Work at the University of Washington and began a career in medical social work that put her in direct contact with dying people - and people who almost died and came back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is the inspirational stories of these near-death experiences, as well as Kimberly's own life challenges in love, family life and the diagnosis of breast cancer, that form the core of this surprisingly funny page-turner of a book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bettie J. Eadie, Author of Embraced by the Light said,  "Kimberly Clark Sharp is truly an exciting and loved spokesperson for the near-death movement. Kim will tantalize and fascinate you as she shares...her extraordinary life of service to the seen and unseen."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Raymond Moody, author of Life After Life, and father of the Near-Death Experience:  "The spirited and spritual Kimberly Clark Sharp opens a new door to the aftereffects of her near-death experience and shows us the supernatural worlds that surround the living and await the dying"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Melvin Morse, author of Closer to the Light adds:  "No one has done more with the near-death experience to serve others than Kimberly Clark Sharp. She was one of the earliest influences on my own understanding of near-death experiences."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other comments:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Experiencer, researcher, clinician...nobody tells it better or with more humor than Kim. A delightfully entertaining writer and a very wise soul."
&lt;br/&gt;~ Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. Author of Heading Toward Omega
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Kimberly Clark-Sharp has produced a remarkable book about her own near-death experience (NDE) and its effects on her life. For many readers, any well-written NDEbook (and this is surely one) will be welcomed. For those uncounted who have been touched by Sharp over the years, this book is long overdue. For the remainder, this is still a book worth reading. It made me cry; it made me laugh; and it made me rethink some of my fundamental ideas. As Sharp might sing into her microphone, Who could ask for anything more?
&lt;br/&gt;~ Bruce Greyson, M.D., University of Virginia
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After the Light is a spiritual roller coaster ride I kept thinking would end, but never did. The book begins with a near-death-experience (NDE) in 1970, and then fast forwards through the miraculous and the incredible as author Kimberly Clark Sharp shares how a byproduct of her NDE, a spiritual-opening-up, allowed her to walk simultaneously in two worlds.
&lt;br/&gt;~ Rick Montgomery, from Angel Times

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Shelley Yates</title>
    <date>2007-05-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr from Nova Scotia</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Shelley Yates, 41, is an ordinary woman on an extraordinary journey. She lives in Nova Scotia, Canada, and has not only died and come back, but had the wonderful good fortune to come back with a message of hope and love for our earth and its inhabitants. Shelley first learned how to apply her new knowledge from beyond to bring her son back from death in an unprecedented display, using the power of faith, love and the manipulation of personal human energy. Her son returned whole and happy. She was told "what you did for a dying boy with a small group of people you can do for a dying planet with a large group." She shares her story of miracles and her knowledge of human energy potential with all that are willing to listen. Her final outcome has been the creation of a world project in which all of humanity can contribute to change the earth we live on, creating prosperity, peace and healing for all that desire it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shelley Yates and her son, Evan, were drowned in 2002 when their car hydroplaned off the road, overturned, and sank to the bottom of a flooded marsh in Nova Scotia.  Shelley was trapped in the car.  A voice told her not to struggle or she would not be able to be revived when she would be rescued.  She had never heard such a voice before this.  She did not believe in God.  She says of herself, "I was a 'diehard atheist'."  Yet, she did not struggle, and she drowned.  It was 15 minutes before she was rescued.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    After she was revived, she alerted the EMT's to find her son, who was age 4 at the time.  Close to 30 minutes passed before he was pulled from the water.  It took more time for the EMT's to get him breathing again.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    At the hospital, he was diagnosed as brain dead with non-viable organs, and given only 1% chance of surviving.  However, Shelley was told by the voice that he would recover if many persons came and shared the energy of their auras for 20 minutes each.  She was told that this would in effect "jump-start" Evan.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So Shelley scheduled people to come to the hospital around the clock for three days.  After 72 hours of constant vigil, Evan opened his eyes and recognized his mother.  His recovery proceeded rapidly after that.  He was in excellent shape after only six weeks.  He did have a short-term memory problem, but now even that has been healed.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   The voices also told Shelley that the earth needs the same help.  We share energy with the earth in a living loop.  However, because so many of us have disconnected from Source, our energy is so low that we are not returning energy to the earth.  As a result the auric energy field of the earth has been depleted and is disintegrating.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Shelley was told that we can "jump-start" the energy system of the earth if we combine the energy of our love and gratitude for one hour beginning at 11:11 a. m. GMT on Wednesday, July 17, 2007 (That's 6:11 a. m. to 7:11 a. m. Eastern Time.)  We are invited to join in a world-wide vigil for that hour, holding within our consciousness something that brings joy and for which we feel thankful.  We are asked to extend gratitude to the earth because energy is sent out when we are in that state of mind.  The resulting surge of energy will be a catalyst to enable the earth to sustain its own energy again.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Shelley was also told that those who participate will be able to accelerate the growth of their own field, and that this will lead them into the next stage of the development of humankind, which will be lived at the higher frequency of love and gratitude.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The hour of recharging the energy of the earth's field will be only the beginning.  Over time we can expect to see changes so that the earth's resources will be shared to meet the needs of everyone, starting with those on the African continent.  The goal is to unite this world as one planet - to establish peace and prosperity for all.  This is not Shelley's plan.  It was dictated to her by the voices that she still hears.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The word has been spreading.  The message, plan, and invitation have been translated into ten languages with two more soon to receive it.  Local coordinators have been spreading the information in 200 countries.  The plan is becoming common knowledge among youth.

    <subtitle>Author of "The Walk-in," NDEr,Intuitive</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In one remarkable exchange of spirits, Shari's soul left her body and Juelle's soul moved in. This is the story of a spiritual journey of change, growth and expanded consciousness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Juelle "walked-in" 16 years ago, to a life perfectly prepared for her by the walk-out, Shari.  Since then, her mission to facilitate the creation of heaven on earth has accelerated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Juelle has worked in the field of metaphysics as a teacher and international workshop facilitator for the past 20 years. She is a conscious channel who acts as a third-dimensional conduit for "The Concil of Twelve."  She has published many magazine articles on walk-ins as well as on other topics related to practical spirituality and planetary evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She and her husband, Donovan, founded Light Star Mission.  Together they conduct workshops as well as private counseling sessions all across North America and also conduct international spiritual pilgrimages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Juelle creates her own heaven on Earth by hiking in the mountains, growing flowers, exploring the seashore and traveling with Donovan.  They have lived in many exotic places, including Costa Rica and Thailand and they currently reside in Colorado.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Juelle will be giving private one-on-one readings on Sunday and Monday, June 10 and 11.  For more info, call Chicago IANDS at 847.251.5758.

    <title>Guest Speaker: Dr. Ron Cavenaugh, Psy.D.</title>
    <date>2007-07-14</date>
    <subtitle>Director of Treatment, State of Alabama Prison System;   3 Videos of Buddhist Meditation used in prison systems...outstanding!</subtitle>
    <body>(Last minute rescheduling of Paul Elder to Dec 8, 2007, due to unforeseen difficulty....)

&lt;p&gt;
DOING TIME, DOING VIPASSANA (52 minutes)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the mid-1970s Vipassana was first tried within a prison environment with two 10 day courses being conducted for jail officials and inmates of a prison in Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Despite the success of those courses, no further jail courses were conducted in India for almost 20 years. In 1993 a new Inspector General of Indian prisons, Kiran Bedi, was appointed and in the process of trying to reform the harsh Indian penal system, learned of the earlier Vipassana courses. She requested that additional courses be conducted in the largest prison in India, Tihar Jail outside of New Delhi. The results were dramatically sucessful. Based upon the success of these courses, another course was conducted in April 1994 by Goenkaji and a number of his assistant teachers for over one thousand inmates of Tihar prison with wonderful benefit for all of those who participated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During the following winter of 1994-95, the Israeli filmmakers traveled to both Tihar and to the Baroda Jail in the India state of Gujarat, at which Vipassana courses had also been conducted. There they conducted and filmed extensive interviews with jail officials, including Karen Bedei, and inmates from many different countries who participated in the courses. The result of these efforts was an extremely powerful 52-minute documentary film entitled Doing Time, Doing Vipassana. The film describes the way in which Vipassana has been sucessfully used within the Indian prison system to dramatically change the behaviour and attitude of the inmates and jailers who participated in the courses and, thereby, improve the entire atmosphere of the prisons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana&lt;/i&gt; has been broadcast in many diverse international markets including the following stations and networks: PBS - USA; NHK - Japan; YLE - Finland; TSI - Switzerland; DR TV - Denmark; Channel 8 - Israel; and TV Poland. The film also recently won the prestigeous Golden Spire Award at the 1998 San Franisco International Film Festival. The Festival's management wrote as follows about the jury's decision:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    'In giving &lt;i&gt;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana&lt;/i&gt; its top honour, the jury for the category stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    "The jury was moved by this insightful and poignant exposition on Vipassana. The teaching of this meditation as a transformation device has many implications for people everywhere, providing the cultural, social and political institutions can embrace and support its liberating possibility."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This year's Golden Gate awards competition was incredibly strong &amp; close, as we had a over 1600 entries from 58 countries in the 35 categories.'
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
DTDV most recently won a "Silver Plaque" award in the INTERCOM - The International Communications Film &amp; Video Competition, in Chicago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The film also received an award in 1999 from the American National Council on Crime &amp; Delinquency ("NCCD"). NCCD wrote as follows about its decision to present this award:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    'Congratulations! I am pleased to inform you that you are a recipient of the NCCD PASS Awards. The National Council on Crime &amp; Delinquency is honored to recognize your excellence in communicating the complex problems of crime to the American people. We hope this award will serve as a contact reminder that your work can make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A distinguished panel of experts found your work, &lt;i&gt;"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana"&lt;/i&gt;, to be worthy of recognition and deserving of special acclaim. This award is presented to members of the media who have made an important contribution toward raising the public's awareness and understanding of our criminal and juvenile justice system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FREEDOM BEHIND BARS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Freedom Behind Bars&lt;/i&gt; is a short 11 minute video which is excerpted from the film &lt;i&gt;The Dhamma Brothers&lt;/i&gt; and gives some information about the use of meditation in the maximum security W.E. Donaldson Prison, in Bessemer, Alabama.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CHANGING FROM INSIDE
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The film, entitled &lt;i&gt;Changing from Inside&lt;/i&gt; is 42 minutes long. It was written and produced primarily for an audience of prison administrators, jail officials, judges, etc. and tells the story of the introduction of Vipassana meditation courses into the North Rehabilitation Facility (N.R.F.) of the King County jail in Seattle, Washington, USA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The film attempts to answer many of the questions that come from corrections officials after they have seen the earlier film entitled &lt;i&gt;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana,&lt;/i&gt; documenting the introduction of this meditation into the prisons of India, or after the idea of meditation as a reform measure has been introduced to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In general, &lt;i&gt;Changing from Inside&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling account of an intensive pilot meditation program for inmates at the N.F.R. minimum security jail near Seattle, Washington. Under the guidance of both community volunteers and facility staff members, seven women inmates undertake ten days of total silence. They practice the ancient meditation technique of Vipassana for ten hours each day, delving ever deeper into themselves to understand and ultimately master the nature of their behaviors and compulsions. In the end, they are transformed by their inward journey and come away with tools to maintain that transformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Changing from Inside&lt;/i&gt; also chronicles the personal and professional journey of the articulate, determined facility director, Lucia Meijer, as she rallies her staff to undertake and implement this new and unconventional program. Candid interviews among prison staff reveal a range of reactions, from interest to skepticism. However, the results achieved by the course prove to be an inspiration to everyone involved in the project including the participatants, other inmates and the professional staff, leaving the facility transformed, as well.

    <subtitle>Three Films outlining the use of Meditation in Prisons:
Doing Time, Doing Vipassana,
Changing From Inside,
Freedom Behind Bars</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Repeat of last month's videos for those unable to make it last month.  Outstanding films.  Do not miss this opportunity!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
DOING TIME, DOING VIPASSANA (52 minutes)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the mid-1970s Vipassana was first tried within a prison environment with two 10 day courses being conducted for jail officials and inmates of a prison in Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Despite the success of those courses, no further jail courses were conducted in India for almost 20 years. In 1993 a new Inspector General of Indian prisons, Kiran Bedi, was appointed and in the process of trying to reform the harsh Indian penal system, learned of the earlier Vipassana courses. She requested that additional courses be conducted in the largest prison in India, Tihar Jail outside of New Delhi. The results were dramatically sucessful. Based upon the success of these courses, another course was conducted in April 1994 by Goenkaji and a number of his assistant teachers for over one thousand inmates of Tihar prison with wonderful benefit for all of those who participated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During the following winter of 1994-95, the Israeli filmmakers traveled to both Tihar and to the Baroda Jail in the India state of Gujarat, at which Vipassana courses had also been conducted. There they conducted and filmed extensive interviews with jail officials, including Karen Bedei, and inmates from many different countries who participated in the courses. The result of these efforts was an extremely powerful 52-minute documentary film entitled Doing Time, Doing Vipassana. The film describes the way in which Vipassana has been sucessfully used within the Indian prison system to dramatically change the behaviour and attitude of the inmates and jailers who participated in the courses and, thereby, improve the entire atmosphere of the prisons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana&lt;/i&gt; has been broadcast in many diverse international markets including the following stations and networks: PBS - USA; NHK - Japan; YLE - Finland; TSI - Switzerland; DR TV - Denmark; Channel 8 - Israel; and TV Poland. The film also recently won the prestigeous Golden Spire Award at the 1998 San Franisco International Film Festival. The Festival's management wrote as follows about the jury's decision:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    'In giving &lt;i&gt;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana&lt;/i&gt; its top honour, the jury for the category stated:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    "The jury was moved by this insightful and poignant exposition on Vipassana. The teaching of this meditation as a transformation device has many implications for people everywhere, providing the cultural, social and political institutions can embrace and support its liberating possibility."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This year's Golden Gate awards competition was incredibly strong &amp; close, as we had a over 1600 entries from 58 countries in the 35 categories.'
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
DTDV most recently won a "Silver Plaque" award in the INTERCOM - The International Communications Film &amp; Video Competition, in Chicago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The film also received an award in 1999 from the American National Council on Crime &amp; Delinquency ("NCCD"). NCCD wrote as follows about its decision to present this award:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    'Congratulations! I am pleased to inform you that you are a recipient of the NCCD PASS Awards. The National Council on Crime &amp; Delinquency is honored to recognize your excellence in communicating the complex problems of crime to the American people. We hope this award will serve as a contact reminder that your work can make a difference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    A distinguished panel of experts found your work, &lt;i&gt;"Doing Time, Doing Vipassana"&lt;/i&gt;, to be worthy of recognition and deserving of special acclaim. This award is presented to members of the media who have made an important contribution toward raising the public's awareness and understanding of our criminal and juvenile justice system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FREEDOM BEHIND BARS
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Freedom Behind Bars&lt;/i&gt; is a short 11 minute video which is excerpted from the film &lt;i&gt;The Dhamma Brothers&lt;/i&gt; and gives some information about the use of meditation in the maximum security W.E. Donaldson Prison, in Bessemer, Alabama.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
CHANGING FROM INSIDE
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The film, entitled &lt;i&gt;Changing from Inside&lt;/i&gt; is 42 minutes long. It was written and produced primarily for an audience of prison administrators, jail officials, judges, etc. and tells the story of the introduction of Vipassana meditation courses into the North Rehabilitation Facility (N.R.F.) of the King County jail in Seattle, Washington, USA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The film attempts to answer many of the questions that come from corrections officials after they have seen the earlier film entitled &lt;i&gt;Doing Time, Doing Vipassana,&lt;/i&gt; documenting the introduction of this meditation into the prisons of India, or after the idea of meditation as a reform measure has been introduced to them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In general, &lt;i&gt;Changing from Inside&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling account of an intensive pilot meditation program for inmates at the N.F.R. minimum security jail near Seattle, Washington.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guest:  Dimtiri Topitzes, Ph.D., is a Vipassana Meditator and Trust member of the Illinois Vipassana Meditation Center, located just outside Rockford, IL.  Topitzes works as a clinical therapist in the Milwaukee, WI area and also teaches at the University of Wisconsin &amp;#8211; Milwaukee.  His research interests include the psychosocial effects of Vipassana meditation on men, women and adolescents placed in correctional facilities or at-risk for such placement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Topitzes will be doing a question and answer session about Vipassana Meditation, in general, and the Illinois center, in particular.

    <title>Guest Speaker: Yolaine Stout</title>
    <date>2007-09-08</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr from Suicide Attempt; President of IANDS</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Yolaine Stout is the current President of the International Association for Near-Death Studies, a near-death experiencer, a writer, strategic planner and life coach.  An honors graduate from the UC Berkeley School of Education in 1976,  she taught languages for 25 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1982, she had a suicidal NDE due to severe depression over a failing marriage, poor health and inability to conceive. An atheist at the time, her NDE  turned her beliefs about the purpose and meaning of life---and what follows---inside out.  As a result  of her NDE and learning how to "tune in," she was able to conquer her depression and among other achievements, helped a struggling non-profit organization raise several million dollars to purchase land for a nature preserve.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yolaine sees it as her purpose in life to help individuals and non-profit organizations discover the power of vision, purpose and passion.    She retired from teaching languages five years ago to devote herself full-time to this purpose.  She is currently finishing a self-help book for people suffering from depression, which is largely based on lessons about life learned during near-death experiences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A desire to speak to other suicidal NDErs led Yolaine to IANDS.  She was invited to join the board after they learned of her experience in non-profit development.  She is the author of a recent article:  6 Major Challenges Faced by Near-Death Experiencers  (Journal for Near-Death Studies), and is collaborating with Dr. Kenneth Ring on a workshop and workbook based on &lt;i&gt;Lessons from the Light.  &lt;/i&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Deana Chase-Moore</title>
    <date>2007-10-13</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, massage therapist,reflexologist, intuitive shares her wonderful and amazing experiences....</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Deanna Chase-Moore was born in Missouri just before World War II.  Her family soon moved and she grew up in California&amp;#65533;s Bay Area.  During her early childhood, she had unusual experiences which were unexplainable for any three or four year old.  The explanation took nearly thirty years to reveal itself, but this became a window to her life's work as a touch therapist.  Two Near-Death Experiences revealed to Deana the truths of energy and how you view a different perspective of relationships, health and religion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deanna's story is one of the most intense and funny stories, about a child who didn't want to touch or be touched by other people, who became a massage therapist whose touch would reveal to her the past-lives of those she massaged.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A warm, delightful person who is fully intuitive, Ms. Moore will be doing private reflexology sessions on Sun and Mon, Oct 14 and 15.  Call 847.251.5758 after September 6, 2007, for an appointment and get in touch with your past lives!

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Robert Schwartz</title>
    <date>2007-11-10</date>
    <subtitle>Author of Courageous Souls, will talk about his "Bliss" experience and how it changed his life...</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In a personal session with a medium in 2003, author Robert Schwartz was astonished to speak with nonphysical beings who knew everything about him - not just what he had done in life, but also what he had thought and felt. They told him that he had planned many of his most difficult experiences before he was born. Realizing that a knowledge of pre-birth planning would bring great healing to people and allow them to understand the deeper purpose of their life challenges, he devoted the next three years to studying the pre-birth plans of dozens of individuals. The extraordinary insights that emerged speak to our heartfelt, universal yearning to know . . . why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Prior to his spiritual awakening, Mr. Schwartz was a freelance journalist for such publications as Life magazine and US News &amp; World Report.  He has also worked extensively in the corporate sector in marketing and communications.  He holds a BA from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Case Western Reserve University.  He also experienced a "Bliss" experience that had a profound affect upon him, which he will discuss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As a special added attraction, Deborah DeBari, well-known Chicago intuitive and contributor to Rob's book,&lt;i&gt; Courageous Souls, &lt;/i&gt;will also be speaking at this meeting. Don't miss it!

    <body>&lt;p&gt;

Paul Elder has spent a lifetime studying human nature from a unique perspective. He is a survivor of three near-death experiences: a drowning at the age of 12, a car accident at 17, and a heart attack at the age of 41. Along with the trauma and subsequent beauty of death came a series of spontaneous spiritual events &amp;#8212; events that would turn his belief system upside down, leaving him with profound insights as to our true nature and purpose in the universe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After spending nearly a decade as a radio and television news reporter, Elder ventured into a career of politics and business spanning more than 20 years. Forever grateful for his near-death experiences, his spiritual insights helped to mold and deeply influence his approach to politics, business, and life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now a trainer at the Monroe Institute in Virginia, Paul lives on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and spends his time writing, teaching, and speaking throughout the United States and Canada on the phenomenon of near-death and out-of-body experiences.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Mark Macy</title>
    <date>2008-04-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, Cancer Survivor, Author, Researcher on Spritual Communication
</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Mark Macy was an atheist until cancer and a resulting near-death experience set him on a spiritual search in the 1980s. He was looking for proof---or good, solid evidence of an afterlife, which led him to the miracles of ITC, or instrumental transcommunication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers claimed to be getting personal letters planted mysteriously in their computers by invisible hands of spirit friends. They reported that faces and landscapes from the other side were flashing across their TV screens, and they were having actual phone dialogs with angels. Mark thought this all sounded a little strange, to say the least, but when he visited the leading researchers in Europe, he was amazed by what he found&amp;#8230; physical evidence, veritable proof that communication was really going on between Heaven and Earth. And he's immersed himself in ITC since 1991.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the use of a special subtle energy device called a "luminator," he has photographed many clear spirit faces of late colleagues, loved ones, and celebrities, including John Denver. The results of his research can be seen on his websites and in his recent books, &lt;i&gt;Spirit Faces, Truth about the Afterlife,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Miracles in the Storm.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He gives lectures and workshops on the afterlife, which include techniques of communicating with the other side through equipment, contacting spirit guides, and soliciting help from the finer realms of spirit to align to our spiritual purpose and personal mission for this lifetime. Special seminars and workshops include the luminator, with the intention of getting spirit faces &amp;#8216;posing&amp;#8217; with the participants in Polaroid photos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Private, half hour sessions will be available on Sunday and Monday, April 13 &amp; 14....from 9-12 am and 2-5 pm.   Each person will receive a couple of photos to take home.  Cost is $60 for each half hour session.   Call 847.251.5758 for an appointment.   Don't delay...the schedule is filling up!

    <title>Guest Speaker:  John Terrell</title>
    <date>2008-05-10</date>
    <subtitle>Many Lives, Many Masters sent John on the equivalent of a NDE, changing his life forever.  Join us for our 10th Anniversary celebration!</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Educated as an architect at the University of Illinois in Chicago (Bachelor of Architecture), John Terrell is a self employed design and development consultant who has over thirty years of diversified design and development experience, with emphasis in commercial/retail/hotel/residential and mixed-use development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In November/December of 1993, after reading &lt;i&gt;Many Lives, Many Masters&lt;/i&gt; by Brian Weiss and &lt;i&gt;Care of the Soul&lt;/i&gt; by Thomas Moore, John had a major awakening of his soul and spirit, setting him off on an inner journey that continues today.  These messages opened John&amp;#8217;s heart to the unknown and gave him the desire to find his purpose in life.  John&amp;#8217;s transformation was heightened during an intense in-person session with Dr. Weiss which was included in Dr. Weiss&amp;#8217;s book  Messages from the Masters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While he was seeking to find and understand the core wisdom, John  participated in numerous workshops and meditation groups and visited many different religious services and ashrams.  He was guided to Reiki, where he found John Gray, one of the original 22 practitioners trained and initiated by Hawayo Takata, and he was initiated by Gray in both First Degree and Advanced Reiki.  He also was initiated by the late Sarah Benson as a Master Teacher in Magnified Healing.  He has studied Feng Shui and eventually John and a friend formed  "Sacred Circle" gatherings in Sedona, AZ, every equinox and solstice for four years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
John has been writing thoughts and inspirations with an eye to future publication. He has been guided by the Heart on his journey and seeks balance through the practice of awareness.  During a recent contemplation of his purpose in this lifetime, he was gifted with the words "Create sacred space for the journey home".  This seems to bring John full circle with his professional and spiritual life.  He is now ready to complete that purpose!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a very inspirational story of a man who is a terrific example to us all of being willing to follow the guidance we receive.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <date>2008-06-14</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Hypnotherapist; explores Past-Lives and Healing, making amazing changes in people's lives.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Jay Stone, DCH, will tell us about his Near-Death Experience when he was six years old, and how it affected his life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jay Stone started his hypnotherapy career in the early 1980s as an affiliate with Partners in Healing, a physician-directed health-care clinic. Most of his work involves health problems, including anxiety, cancer, diabetes, hepatitis, pain management, smoking cessation and weight loss.  Dr. Stone has received an American Board of Hypnotherapy "Special Recognition Award" three times for his hypnotherapy contributions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the host of Inner Quest, a Chicago-area cable television show, he and his guests discuss ancient and modern healing arts and the many paths leading to self-discovery.  Dr. Stone has interviewed Daniel Amen, Joan Borysenko, Ram Dass, Larry Dossey, Judith Orloff, Bernie Siegel and other best-selling authors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jay Stone's first patient was himself! In his very first self-hypnosis session in 1982, he ended his twenty-year nail-biting habit. He next applied hypnosis to his own weight problem. Since 1983 he has not gained back any of the fifty pounds he lost thanks to hypnosis. Dr. Stone has not missed a day of self-hypnosis since that successful first experience in 1982. Pursuing his life's work and utilizing his own unique skills since that time, he has helped people in all walks of life achieve their physical, emotional and financial goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
Because of Stone's knowledge of hypnosis and past life regression, Hidden Treasures Production and Koch Vision featured him in a documentary film which was released in March, 2007.  His book,&lt;i&gt; Sacred Cycles&lt;/i&gt;,  explains how mental, emotional and spiritual development are both a process and product of cycles and how the brain, body and mind experience multiple trances each day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An experienced speaker, Jay Stone is a trained hypnotherapist.  He earned his doctorate in clinical hypnotherapy (DCH) from the American Institute of Hypnotherapy, a Master of Business Administration degree from Loyola University and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from the University of Nevada.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  John Lionberger</title>
    <date>2008-08-09</date>
    <subtitle>A bliss experience sent him in a new direction. Formerly an atheist, he is now a chaplain who conducts God workshops in the woods....</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;John Lionberger is the author of &lt;i&gt;Renewal in the Wilderness: A Spiritual Guide to
Connecting With God in the Natural World&lt;/i&gt;. His book traces the history of spiritual
formation in the wilderness, which has been remarkably similar across the world for
thousands of years, and the universality of the experience may be, as Lionberger says,
&amp;#8220;the language with which we can all talk of God without shedding blood.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book is
interspersed with accounts and lessons from his own trips into the wilderness, as well
as vignettes from the people who have joined him. When he isn&amp;#8217;t writing, he&amp;#8217;s taking
people of any faith, and often no faith at all, into the wilderness on trips of spiritual and
life renewal. His ministry is called, appropriately, &amp;#8220;Renewal in the Wilderness.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On a dog
sled trip to the boundary waters in northern Minnesota, he began the adventure as a dedicated agnostic, but he
left the wilderness knowing that he&amp;#8217;d been ambushed by God. In the 25 degrees below zero weather, a warmth flooded over him that he couldn't explain. Over the next year and a half he concluded that he had been visited by God.  It changed everything for
him, taking him from a thirty year career as an advertising executive in the broadcast and cable businesses, to seminary, then to
the idea of taking people into the wilderness for the same kind of experience he had.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Raised in South Bend, IN, Lionberger did his undergraduate work in English at
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. He earned a MSJ degree from the Medill School
of Journalism at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, and a Master of Divinity from
the Chicago Theological Seminary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He currently resides in Evanston, IL, with his wife, Jane, a Presbyterian minister,
and he serves as the chaplain for the Three Crowns Park retirement home. He has also
served on three boards for Outward Bound, and has received extensive wilderness
training from both Outward Bound and from the National Outdoor Leadership School
(NOLS). He has two grown children, Annie and Jack.

    <subtitle>NDEr, Sound Healer from Hawaii, uses Didjeridu, world flutes, crystal bowls, keyboards, harp, voice, etc.  </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Kimba Arem is a performer and recording artist, and has been a musician since age seven with classical training in piano and flute. She received a B.S. in molecular and cellular biology at the University of Arizona in 1993. While attending acupuncture graduate school studying Chinese Taoist Medicine, she was introduced to sound therapy. Since then she has developed her own unique practice, grown out of extensive subtle energy training in sound as medicine, herbology, Reiki (master level) and aromatherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kimba also works with light and color, and has incorporated these diverse elements into her frequency therapy practice in Kaua'i, Hawai'i. In a session she uses essential oils, acupressure, a "vibrasound" bed and a hem-synch brainwave light machine, yet the primary focus is on playing various indigenous and classical instruments in the subtle fields around the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her main instrument is the Australian didjeridu, but she also uses Native American flutes, four-chambered Celtic flute, Tibetan and crystal bowls, keyboards, tingshaws, tuning forks, a harp, vocal overtoning, and recites various therapeutic mantras from different cultures around the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kimba has released eight CDs, including Self-Healing with Andrew Weil, and she tours internationally, playing at conferences and at institutes around the world. She plays locally, inter-island, on the mainland, and travels internationally doing peace music concerts, conferences, workshops, and sound therapy sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She is the founding member of Heartherapy; an organization dedicated to educating and assisting the planet in gentle awakening through sound.

    <title>Guest Speakers:  Dr. Peter Fenwick &amp; Susan Wisehart</title>
    <date>2008-10-11</date>
    <subtitle>A DOUBLE FEATURE!  Dr. Peter Fenwick, from London, England, one of the world's leading NDE researchers, and the unveiling of Susan Wisehart's new book---and participation in a soul-guided journey to your ideal future!  What a day!</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Our meeting will introduce TWO NEW BOOKS by TWO FABULOUS AUTHORS.  Dr. Peter Fenwick will be introducing his new book, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Dying&lt;/i&gt;(Continuum Books, NY) (written with his wife, Elizabeth) and Susan Wisehart will introduce her new book, &lt;i&gt;Soul Visioning: Clear the Past, Create Your Future" &lt;/i&gt;(Llwellyn Worldwide).  Don't miss this exciting synergy!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A neuropsychiatrist and fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Peter Fenwick is a leading clinical authority on near-death experiences. He has analyzed more than 300 of these life-altering events in the course of four decades of research and is highly regarded both by medical colleagues and by the media for his knowledge of this subject.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1996, Dr. Fenwick became a consulting neuropsychiatrist emeritus to the Epilepsy Unit at the Maudsley Hospital, which he ran for twenty years. He is also chairman of the Scientific and Medical Network, a group of doctors and scientists seeking to deepen understanding in science and medicine by fostering intuitive as well as rational insights. He has had a longstanding interest in brain function, the relationship of the mind and the brain, and the &amp;#8220;problem&amp;#8221; of consciousness. He has an extensive research record and has published over 200 papers in medical and scientific journals on brain function and also several papers on meditation and altered states of consciousness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With over 240 papers in medical and scientific journals to his credit, Fenwick has also coauthored three popular books with his wife, Elizabeth Fenwick: &lt;i&gt;The Truth in the Light&lt;/i&gt; (1997), &lt;i&gt;Past Lives: An Investigation into Reincarnation Memories&lt;/i&gt; (1999), and &lt;i&gt;The Hidden Door: Understanding and Controlling Dreams&lt;/i&gt; (1999).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Susan Wisehart will take you on a soul-guided journey into your ideal future to envision and create in holographic time&amp;#8212;where all realities exist&amp;#8212;your ideal future in the areas of work, career, relationships, finances, health and spirituality. This process uses higher soul guidance, the part of your mind that is lucid, wise, creative and inspired.  Learn about tools to clear the unconscious limiting beliefs that sabotage your soul's vision for your life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Susan Wisehart has a master&amp;#8217;s degree in psychology and over 30 years of
professional experience. She is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, a Holistic
Psychotherapist, Nationally Certified School
Psychologist, and Certified Hypnotherapist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In her private practice with clients, Susan
uses traditional and non-traditional approaches
to help her clients to heal body, mind, and
spirit. She is the developer of Soul VisioningTM,
a guided process whereby clients access
higher Soul guidance to envision and create
their ideal future in holographic time (where all
potentials exist simultaneously). Susan uses
psycho-spiritual and holistic approaches in
assisting her clients to clear the unconscious
patterns and cellular memories from past lives
and this life, to more deeply connect with
their True Self as a Soul. These methods
include hypnotherapy, Energy Psychology
(EMDR, EFT, HMR, WHEE), and both past-life
and Life-Between-Lives spiritual regression,
integrated with more traditional approaches.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Susan received certification in Life-Between-
Lives regressions from Michael Newton, PhD,
author of &lt;i&gt;Journey of Souls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Destiny of Souls&lt;/i&gt;.

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Dannion Brinkley, DOA</title>
    <date>2008-12-13</date>
    <subtitle>Author of Saved by the Light, One of the most celebrated NDErs in history!  Don't miss this opportunity to get to know him!</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;

Dannion Brinkley is an international best selling author. He has recently written the third installment drawing from his personal voyage and near-death encounters entitled, Secrets of the Ligh: Lessons from Heaven, (Harper One), an intuitively profound manual that focuses on spiritual strategies to empower your daily life in the framework of eternity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Co-authored with his wife, Kathryn, &lt;i&gt;The Secrets of the Light: Lessons from Heaven&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the messages Dannion received from Thirteen Beings of Light during his journeys to the other side. These lessons will compel you to re-evaluate your life and re-connect to Spirit, through awareness and understanding that will lead to self-realization and ultimately spiritual enfoldment. This celestial guide book introduces the Four-Fold Path to Power, and shares a highly effective system to raise one's consciousness and augment a relationship with all humankind. Inspiring and thought-provoking, &lt;i&gt;The Secrets of the Light:Lessons from Heaven&lt;/i&gt; offers insight, tools for application, and a priceless key to understanding the dynamics of eternity
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In his lectures and tours, Dannion imparts a paramount message designed to empower his listeners, teaching them step by step how to find purpose, power and greatness in their lives. He has been praised as 'the best orator in the field' by many of his compeers on the lecture circuit. Dannion's speaking engagements lend a vibrancy and colorful approach about the world as we know it, and highlighted with a savvy sense of humor and genuine style. The Secrets of the Light lecture series offer a candid, celebratory approach of the spiritual dynamic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Brinkley's previous works, &lt;i&gt;Saved By The Light&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;At Peace In The Light&lt;/i&gt;, have sold millions worldwide, garnering international acclaim in addition to being a New York Times best seller. His books, tours and workshops have literally transformed the consciousness of audiences on a global capacity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dannion's expertise in the area of death and dying has educated millions not to fear the presently held concept of dying. As a result of his journeys to the 'other side' and back again, he brings to the forefront the wondrous truth that there is indeed no such thing as death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dannion has survived insurmountable odds including two lightning strikes, open-heart surgery, brain surgery and a massive grand mal seizure. Many concur that Mr. Brinkley is a "walking miracle"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In related issues surrounding the death process, Brinkley is one of the early crusaders of hospice and palliative care bringing the topic of end of life care to the forefront of discussion and education in America. Dannion created a non-profit organization, The Twilight Brigade (Compassion in action) to recruit hospice volunteers for dying Veterans. He has been a hospice volunteer for over twenty-four years, having personally accrued more than 10,000 hours at the bedside. These years of tremendous hands-on experience qualify him as a leading expert in the grief and bereavement process as well as being an authority in the field of necrophobic reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2001, Dannion was nominated for the National Hospice and Palliative Care Association's prestigious Heart of Hospice Award. Dannion was also a contributor in the story compilation of Chicken Soup for the Veteran's Soul. His input was used to improve awareness of the honor of veteran service. Compassion in Action / The Twilight Brigade was featured in the December 2000 issue of The Oprah Magazine segment on Volunteerism. In 2004, Dannion provided testimony, "Describing Death in America" to the National Cancer Advisory Board of the Institute of Medicine and presented comment to the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Policy, on "Improving End of Life care with Complementary and Alternative Medicines" and "You Cannot Drug A Child to Safety: Ways of Reducing Stress in America."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dannion has appeared on every major national television and radio show, including Larry King, Oprah, Dateline, Unsolved Mysteries, Art Bell, The Pax Network, and many others. A made for television movie based on Dannion's best seller, Saved By The Light, debuted as one of the highest rated television movies in FOX Television Network history. This exceptional movie starring Eric Roberts is currently airing on a regular basis on the Lifetime Network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When not on tour, Dannion enjoys his time spent at home with his wife, Kathryn, and their six children. Life with his twin soul, five girls and one boy afford him the luxury of witnessing the transformational transactions of true love and spirituality in action.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Lisa Stuckel</title>
    <date>2009-02-14</date>
    <subtitle>Near-Death Experiences from seven major brain surgeries and two strokes, profoundly changed a young woman into a dedicated volunteer who now changes others' lives. </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;

While she was a college student at U of I in Champaign-Urbana, after she experienced lots of migraine headaches and seizures, Lisa Stuckel was told that she had an Arterio-Venous Malformation (AVM).  This problem is genetic, but Lisa didn&amp;#8217;t want to deal with it because she thought, &amp;#8220;I have my fantastic life, and I do not want anything to stand in my way.&amp;#8221;   In 1990, in her late 20s, she finally elected to have brain surgery to correct the AVM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before 1990, Lisa thought she had it all. She calls it her 1st life.  She had a fantastic career.  She was the Regional Manager of ten Carson Pirie Scott stores in Illinois and Wisconsin.  She also started her own successful jewelry design business, called &amp;#8220;Box Barge.&amp;#8221;    She had &amp;#8220;the most perfect boyfriend&amp;#8221; who, like Lisa, had a creative career, was physically active, with a supportive family and lots of friends.   And, right before her medical trauma, Lisa had just purchased a brand new Chrysler LeBaron.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Later in her twenties, Lisa&amp;#8217;s seizures started to get much more frequent and escalated to much more intense, grand mal seizures.  She thought eventually she might die from them, or that she might kill someone in her car if she ever had a seizure while driving.  She knew she could not continue to live with that pressure anymore.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1988, with her father and her neurologist, they  researched to find the best neurosurgeon in the country.  She flew to several cities to meet the doctors and to look at their hospitals.  She chose Dr. Robert Spetzler, a  neurosurgeon from St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, at the Barrow Neurological Institute.  When she met him and looked at his hospital, she felt it all clicked for her.  She thought she would have brain surgery, a couple of months of  therapy, and then she would be back at work.  However, on a scale of 1-5, and 5 being the worst and largest malformation, Lisa had a 5.  Also, Dr Spetzler did warn Lisa that strokes are a risk factor with this type of surgery, but that didn&amp;#8217;t deter her.  She knew she had to do it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Spetzler realized that because the malformation was so large, he would have to operate on it a small section at a time.  So, all together, Lisa suffered 2 strokes during 7 brain surgeries!!  For a while she was in a drug-induced coma and she only had a 50/50 chance of living.  When she started to recover, she was paralyzed on her whole left side, she was blind, she could not walk, talk or even dress herself.  Everyone looked at her as if she was a baby, starting over again!  Lisa&amp;#8217;s family was told that Lisa would never again live on her own.  It was a devastating time in her still young life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lisa felt that through the power from the Beings Up Above, through excellent doctors, through a fabulous therapist, and maybe most important, through the Power Within, she utilized the true keys to recovery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After Lisa's medical madness, she lost her first life!  She lost her career, her boyfriend, her car, her apartment, her sense of humor, some of her memory and even her personality!  She also lost some close relationships that she used to have from brothers, sisters and friends.  Lisa was depressed in the beginning of her recovery, only to realize that the depression was only hindering her from getting better faster.  The key that she felt helped her the most, was recognition of the FIGHTER within herself.  Through hard work during therapies, through positive thinking, through the power of prayer&amp;#8230;..who knows how far we can soar?  Even though most of her doctors told her that she would recover in about 12 years, her recovery has been almost 20 years, and she feels that she is still recovering.  She always thinks:  Do not ever give up!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When Lisa was told that she had a 50/50 chance of living, she had a Spiritual experience!  She will tell you that she was not a perfect person in any way, and she still can not believe that it happened.  One night when she was in bed but not sleeping, she saw Jesus!  He said to her: &amp;#8220;You are going to get better, and you will need to help others who are going through  similar experiences to yours.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
About three years after her rehabilitation, she started to volunteer at Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, IL.  She volunteers on the 6W floor, the rehabilitation unit helping mostly brain injured, stroke, and amputee patients.  Finally, she realized why she is still here on this earth&amp;#8230;to help others in recovery.  She also volunteers at Marianjoy Rehabilitation Center in Wheaton, Il, where she was also a patient in 1990.  For a while, in the late 1990s she was also doing volunteer work at the American Heart Association and at Alexian Brothers Medical Center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lisa feels, even though she lost so much of her first life, she gained 3x more in this 2nd life. Even though she had to start over again, she looks at it as  &amp;#8220;Thank God I have the opportunity to start over!&amp;#8221;   She also married a fine, loving man about 5 years ago, and today she is much more dedicated to her health.  She exercises and jogs, and sleeps twice as much as the old days, because she is so much more organized.  She drinks a lot less coffee and alcohol.  She even feels she is a better person and her Spiritual side is much stronger.   She continues to focus on the positive things of life, calling them &amp;#8220;the keys to health and happiness. &amp;#8220;

She then moved into television, reviewing movies and filing entertainment reports for superstation WGN for three years before moving over to CBS news. She spent three years at CBS affiliate WBBM-TV in Chicago as an anchor and reporter, where she was honored with an Emmy Award in 2000 for her on-camera reporting. Jenniffer co-hosted a weekly talk show on WLS-AM radio for 2 years before moving over to WGN-AM.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Denise Sutherland</title>
    <date>2009-04-11</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Angel Therapy Practitioner, Denise gives Angel readings and hosts the Higher Consciousness radio show on WJJG every week.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;From Denise Sutherland's web site:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Born a spiritual person, I have had a great interest in the Divine from my toddler years forward. Although my religious upbringing and background served me well for most of my life, my heart and soul experienced a revival when a few years ago I began studying metaphysics and pursing New Age avenues for personal healing. As a result of my spiritual study and healing work, my eyes, my arms and my heart have been opened to now fully embrace the commonality of all faith traditions, and the course has been set for fulfilling my life&amp;#8217;s purpose with the help of the angels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An aura photo and reading during my time of spiritual transformation reintroduced me to the presence of my angels and also to the psychic abilities I had shelved as a child long ago. With the help of Dr. Doreen Virtue&amp;#8217;s Daily Guidance from Your Angels Oracle Cards, I began to redevelop my relationship with the angels and to again rely on their Divine guidance and wisdom. As my ensemble of angel oracle cards increased, so did my psychic abilities and card-reading proficiency. In addition to consulting with the angels for personal guidance, I began conducting readings for my family and friends.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The personal healing and spiritual growth experienced by my family and friends through my angel readings was most rewarding for me. I was certain I wanted to broaden my path as a healer, yet I believed the next step to helping others heal was by teaching hot yoga. Despite distinct guidance against this notion from the angels, I enrolled in the nine-week yoga training. Within a few days of adhering to the course protocol, my body began to seriously struggle from the extreme heat and the intensity of the training. Even with medical attention and supplementation, my body was incredibly weak and depleted. The voices of my angels spoke loudly to me through my body, frantically urging me to discontinue the training; yet my ego voice prompted me to push forward to completion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the Friday of the sixth week, my organs began to fail from a severe sodium and electrolyte imbalance. At the moment of my near-death experience, I was surrounded by many of my fellow trainees whose care and attention clearly saved my life. These caring and loving individuals, I soon realized, were my angels intervening on God&amp;#8217;s behalf to not only spare my life, but to also redirect me to the path of my Divine Purpose. As I convalesced the next afternoon, I followed through with the promise of an angel reading for a yoga friend. Looking up from my cards at the completion of her reading, I marveled at the growing line of yoga friends also awaiting their personal messages from the angels. In that instant, I had a genuine epiphany. Undoubtedly, I was being guided to be an Angel Therapy Practitioner&amp;reg;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certified by Doreen Virtue, Ph.D., www.angeltherapy.com, I am now an Angel Therapy Practitioner&amp;reg;, as well as a Kahuna ARCH Healing Practitioner certified through ARCH Founder and ARCH Master Teacher, Laurie Keako&amp;#8217;a&amp;#8217; Grant, www.archhealing.com. Additionally, I co-host with my friend and spiritual soul mate, Linda Padgurskis, the Higher Consciousness radio show, a show &amp;#8220;to renew your spirit,&amp;#8221; every Thursday at 1:00 PM, on WJJG, 1530 AM in Chicago.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Julie Lapham, PhD</title>
    <date>2009-05-09</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, part Cherokee, PhD in Philosophy, Chemical Engineer, born in England, now lives in NC and teaches Holotropic Breathwork and meditation.


</subtitle>
    <body>
&lt;p&gt;
Julie&amp;#8217;s passion with the interface of life and death, the place of change, no doubt comes from her personal experience with death following an industrial accident some thirty five years ago, when glass tore her wrist and severed an artery and tendon. Because of that life-altering experience she has devoted her life to the study of consciousness states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Over the past fourteen years she has been teaching and facilitating workshops in the cutting edge transpersonal technologies (Holotropic Breathwork). Her work has taken her across the United States and overseas with Stanislav Grof, M.D. who is generally credited as a pioneer in consciousness research, and Jack Kornfield, Ph.D. who calls her a &amp;#8220;wise and skillful teacher, a knowledgeable and trustworthy guide.&amp;#8221;  Her studies have culminated in a doctoral dissertation focusing on the values of transpersonal experiences from The Union Institute in Cincinnati. She&amp;#8217;s also studied with the Swami Rama, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Swami Muktananda. Her Cherokee &amp;#8220;Grandmother&amp;#8221; calls her Oyaner - a female good path maker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A budding polymer chemist climbing the ladder of success credited with both patents and publications, she experienced a change of direction. Suddenly and unexpectedly her world was turned upside down, literally. Since that time her world has been full of sudden and unexpected changes, some large, some not so large.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Julie was recently asked during a leadership forum, &amp;#8220; How do you plan your life?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t,&amp;#8221; she replied. &amp;#8220;I trust the universe. I&amp;#8217;m given what is next. I&amp;#8217;m just along for the ride. And how do I know when I&amp;#8217;m off course - when I&amp;#8216;m following my own plan rather than universes&amp;#8217; plan - things become difficult.)

Julie left her chemical career in 1979 and went to Washington to work for the &amp;#8220;Equal Rights Amendment&amp;#8221; campaign. When that ended she left Washington DC and went to work for a nonprofit in Richmond, Virginia taking early retirement in 1997 to complete a doctoral program. A few years ago she became an interfaith minister.

Nowadays she teaches meditation, facilitates Holotropic Breathwork sessions, and speaks to audiences about her near-death experience. And, she&amp;#8217;s doing a lot of writing.

She says she couldn&amp;#8217;t be happier!

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Jim Macartney, MA</title>
    <date>2009-06-13</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr from Seattle, Rehab Counselor, Author of new book, "Crisis to Creation"</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Why do some of us stay stuck in crisis and others find ways to embrace new opportunities---even entirely new ways of being in the world? What factors work to transform post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) into &amp;#8220;post-traumatic growth&amp;#8221;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   These are two of the questions that rehabilitation counselor and NDE survivor Jim Macartney has long pondered. From his own personal and professional experience, he observed that the answers have something to do with our consciously, and with full intention, CHOOSING to move past our stuckness, stepping past the edge of the known in order to open to higher levels of life expressions.  People growing through crisis exhibit many of the same transformative changes as seen in typical NDE&amp;#8217;s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Although Jim experienced an NDE in 1997 which he calls &amp;#8221;The single most profound event of my life,&amp;#8221; he urges his story be used as a parable to symbolize what may lie outside our conditioned capacity to think and believe. Indeed it is within our power, Jim believes, to experience a much deeper level of our Being Human, turning what seems as irresolvable crises into powerful gifts of new creation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Currently Jim Macartney is synthesizing his research and writing a book which he hopes will help move individuals and our helping institutions from an orientation of fighting disability and limitation to one of fully engaging latent opportunity for growth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Those who&amp;#8217;ve heard him address the NDE community, most recently at the IANDS 2008 conference in Durham, NC, Seattle and Salt Lake City, have reported a profoundly moving experience. </body>

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Alex Hermosillo</title>
    <date>2009-08-08</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, Gifted healer from Arizona, "The Happy Healer" on internet radio. Healing workshop available...details below.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;"In the summer of 1996, while visiting a small Mexican border town for business, the Gift of Healing was awakened within me as a woman handed her six month old dying child to me.  Soon after, an unexpected event occurred that sent me to the hospital emergency room where a second gift was given to me, a near-death experience where I learned there is no such thing as death, only a new beginning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Along my journey, I have been blessed to assist people in healing their migraine headaches, backaches, cancer, heart disease, tumors, depression and more.  During their healing sessions and in my classes, many of them have seen, heard and/or felt the presence of angels and other Heavenly beings, bringing the awareness to them that we are never alone.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many call me a Healer, but the truth is I am a man like any other who has chosen to be in service to others--to share with you the gifts that were given to me--the gifts of Love and Healing."  ~Alex J. Hermosillo
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alex J. Hermosillo is the founder of Mastery of Energy Healing (M.E.H.). M.E.H. is a gentle, non-invasive healing technique that assists the individual in releasing the negative energies and negative memories of unserving thoughts, emotions and patterns that cause illness. Through this releasing process, individuals experience a release of anxiety, stress, worries, fear, confusion, and aches and pains, allowing greater clarity, peace of mind and relief from symptoms of illness. This simple yet powerful technique allows an individual to heal emotionally, mentally and physically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


As a young man, Alex had the ability to help people with their pain with a touch of his hand. Later in life, a Near-Death Experience took him to the other side where he found Peace. He describes his experience, &amp;#8220;All of my pain was released from me&amp;#8230;my heartaches, heartbreaks, negative thoughts, worries, doubts, unserving emotions, and physical illness. It was like my pain was completely erased from my existence. I experienced Peace like I never had before&amp;#8221;. Following this life-altering event, Alex wanted nothing more than to help others experience that peace in their daily lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

With the gift that was given to Alex, along with his experiences of healing, research and dedication, he developed a quick and simple powerful energy healing method called Mastery of Energy Healing (M.E.H.). Alex assists his clients in releasing dense physical, mental and emotional energies, allowing the body to heal the cause. Through M.E.H., Alex is able to teach others how to release their pain, be it emotional, mental or physical. Many have received spontaneous healings from problems such as migraine headaches, backaches, heart disease, tumors and depression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Alex touches the lives of thousands through his lectures, classes and internet radio show, &amp;#8220;The Happy Healer&amp;#8221; on www.achieveradio.com. He travels nationwide, as well as offers his services from his home base in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    Today, Alex dedicates his life to remind you to be happy, and how to become happy is releasing your fears, shames, guilt and judgments towards yourself and others. And to remember &amp;#8211; deep within us in our hearts and our souls &amp;#8211; we are worthy of a happy, healthy, loving life!
&lt;p&gt;
Mastery of Energy Healing Level 1
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex will be doing a Healing Workshop on Sunday, August 9, 2009, 1 - 5 pm, at The Meskill Center at Mallinkrodt in the Park, 1041A Ridge Road, Wilmette, IL 60091.  (www.wilmettepark.org)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Alex is able to awaken the gift of healing in others so they may heal themselves; and he has taught hundreds of people around the country his healing technique.  His clients and students come from all walks of life including artists, teachers, homemakers, children, nurses, doctors and athletes.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alex says anyone can learn the Mastery of Energy Healing Technique. Every one of us has the ability within to help themselves, their loved ones and others. Empower yourself today with the simple tools Alex gives you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In this class you will learn about negative and positive energies, what they are and how they affect us. Alex will give you the tools that are easily understood and implemented to become aware of these energies, and then how to release the negative energies that create illness in the physical, mental and emotional bodies from yourself and others. This technique benefits you, your loved ones and clients alike! Students and clients come from all walks of life including artists, teachers, homemakers, children, nurses, doctors, athletes, and anyone interested in healing.  Healings occasionally occur during these workshops.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


Fee is $250, payable to Chicago IANDS, PO Box 732, Wilmette, IL, 60091.  Participants receive a Certificate upon completion.  To sign up for the workshop, please call 847.251.5758 or sign up at a regular monthly meeting.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Donna McCue</title>
    <date>2009-09-12</date>
    <subtitle>Near-Death Experiencer, Comedienne, author of &lt;i&gt;Your Fate is in Your Hands,&lt;/i&gt;Donna helps people through her humor and psychic ability.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Articulate, personable, and sparkling with humor and insight, Donna McCue has many exciting and memorable stories to tell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Donna is an author, comedienne, radio personality, intuitive consultant (Palmistry), as well as a wife and mother, who is based in East Hampton, New York. Vibrant and quick witted, Ms. McCue is a nationally known intuitive, celebrated locally as the "intuitive consultant to the stars."  She had an intense near-death experience which catapulted her into the work which she so successfully does.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In her twenty-five year practice of the art of intuition, Ms. McCue's clientele has ranged from newscasters to musicians, media personalities to stockbrokers. She has worked as a consultant with the FBI, and for corporations that include Home Box Office (for whom she forecast the future of the creative staff), and Merrill Lynch, who invited her to participate in a semiannual dinner for new brokers in the late eighties. During the dinner with Merrill Lynch employees, Ms. McCue found herself - much to her own surprise - telling at least forty of the attendees that she saw them leaving their jobs. Only days later Black Tuesday descended -- the market crashed and aggressive downsizing began.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. McCue has read the hands of many celebrities, artists and thinkers such as Willem De Kooning, Salvador Dali, William Styron and Faith Popcorn.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Previously a radio personality and standup comedienne, Ms. McCue has a live, call-in public television show, The Donna McCue Show, which can presently be seen on Long Island's Cablevision, and on Manhattan Cable television. Her show boasts a highly original combination of eclectic though accessible elements: wisdom wit, and hands-on healing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the early nineties, Ms. McCue was the numerology and astrology writer for Hampton Magazine. She presently gives corporate and private sector workshops and seminars, geared towards helping others to get in touch with their intuitive abilities through a series of simple interactive exercises. Her book,&lt;i&gt; Your Fate is in Your Hands,&lt;/i&gt; tells her personal story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aside from a full schedule of corporate events and seminars, Donna is raising her two sons with her husband, who she met while doing a reading back in 1981. "I read his hand and the first thing I blurted out was, 'You are going to marry me'. Without missing a beat he answered, 'If I'm going to marry you, perhaps we should have dinner first'." Two years later they were married.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, Donna started a wildly successful new online company:  Fat Ass Fudge. She will be doing private readings on Monday and Tuesday, September 14 and 15.  Call 847.251.5758 for more info or an appointment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Something Unknown is Doing We Don't Know What (2009)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is it possible that some people can read your mind? or look into the future?  Why is it that some people can cure themselves while in the last stages of a deadly cancer?  Does mind over matter really exist, and if so, how do we explain this?  In the US, millions of people claim to "see" distant objects or places.  Do they really "see" something?  And where is the boundary between "real" magical powers and fraud?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Can these "miracles of the mind" be explained?  These and more questions will be answered in the quirky feature documentary (104 minutes) by Dutch filmmaker Renee Scheltema.
&lt;/p&gt;
with Prof. Charles Tart, Dr. Dean Radin, Prof. Gary Schwartz, Dr. Roger Nelson, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Dr. Jack Houck, Dr. David Dosa, Rebecca Good, Nancy Myer, and Catherine Yunt.  View the trailer at: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=016R1c4_HIc"&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Deanna Chase-Moore was born in Missouri just before World War II.  Her family soon moved and she grew up in California's Bay Area.  During her early childhood, she had unusual experiences which were unexplainable for any three or four year old.  The explanation took nearly thirty years to reveal itself, but this became a window to her life's work as a touch therapist.  Two Near-Death Experiences revealed to Deana the truths of energy and how you view a different perspective of relationships, health and religion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deanna's story is one of the most intense and funny stories, about a child who didn't want to touch or be touched by other people, who became a massage therapist whose touch would reveal to her the past-lives of those she massaged.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A warm, delightful person who is fully intuitive, Ms. Moore will be doing private reflexology sessions on Sun and Mon, Nov 15 and 16.  Call 847.251.5758 after September 15, 2009, for an appointment and get in touch with your past lives!

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Stephen Damroth</title>
    <date>2009-12-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr as a result of being murdered by his brother.  Profound story.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Stephen Damroth came from a large Catholic family of 3 girls and 2 boys.   His older brother was diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic twenty years ago.  Stephen was dyslexic and as a result became more passive and quiet.  School was difficult and although he graduated from high school early, he had a difficult time staying in college because of the learning disability and the financial concerns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He was working in a retail store when he was 23, and was sleeping late on his day off (Friday the 13th, October, 1995) when his brother woke him up around 10:00 am to ask him for a cigarette. He told him he would give him one later. He went back to sleep but was awakened just minutes later to see his brother standing over him with a knife---which was descending. He grabbed the knife blade, but due to his brother&amp;#8217;s superior position and his groggy state, he barely managed to slow the blade in its penetration of his chest. They fought as Stephen yelled for help, but the attack didn&amp;#8217;t stop until his mother came to the door to reprimand them for fighting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shocked at the scene, she ran down the hall yelling for her daughter to call 911. By this time his brother had stabbed him four times, completely severing his subclavian artery and damaging the nerve plexus in his shoulder.  Blood was literally hosing from his two chest wounds. After his mothers interruption, his brother stopped and just stood over him, staring blankly....
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So begins the story of Stephen&amp;#8217;s extensive Near-Death Experience and the complete alteration of his life.  Starting in the velvety comforting black space and proceeding to the Light, he was aware of love, knowledge and connectedness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To quote Stephen:
&amp;#8220;.... I was already well on my way toward forgiving my brother for the stabbing, but when I got to the memory of the Light, any bad feelings that I still harbored for him evaporated in that instant. It was like taking a chunk of ice and dropping it into the sun. In an instant, there was not even a wisp of steam remaining of it. As all the negative feelings flashed out of existence from my re-experiencing the Light, the vacuum that they left was filled with Love and compassion for my brother and the rest of humanity.

At that moment, I was a perfect human being devoid of flaws as the light burned them away. I was physically only a few days out of my low point when I reached that emotional and spiritual high point. From then on, I would never be the same person or see the world and my fellow man in the same way again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The influx of memories and grace lasted only a second or two in our time, but their aftereffects are with me still. Within mere seconds I went from being an angry and bitter victim of a terrible crime, to being a Joyous, Loving, and thankful recipient of the most beautiful and wondrous gift. The circumstances hadn't changed, I had.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Immediately after my experience, I was able to see both worlds as if I had on foot in each plane. The spiritual and the physical blended into a homogeneous whole. I could see auras around people and spirits, and I could feel the emotions of others as if they were my own. &amp;#8220;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
...Don't miss hearing Stephen's whole story in person.  It will change your life as well!

    <date>2010-01-09</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; died twice---extensive life review; lawyer; US Air Force Academy Prep</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Chris Markey was born July 29, 1950 in Maywood, Illinois.  Immediately after his birth, his father left from the hospital for 22 months in Korea.  At the age of 5 his family moved to Hubbard Woods, IL, and he attended Sacred Heart grammar school (Fransiscan Sisters), Loyola Academy, where they won the city championship in 1965 and 1966, then the U.S. Air Force Academy Prep school (red shirted), Xavier University, Loyola University of Chicago, B.A., 1973.  DePaul University, double MS in Administration of Rehabilitation Services, 1977.  Juris Doctor degree, 1996, from The John Marshall Law School.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


Chris' Dad was Howard T. Markey, the only surviving jet test pilot of the original ten high altitude test pilots in Alaska.  Eventual Major General, Commander of Illinois Air National Guard at O'Hare, Named by Nixon as a Federal judge in 1972, formed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and was its first Chief Judge (nineteen years).  The same Howard T. Markey after whom the Congress renamed the National Courthouse.  Nothing much to live up to!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Chris married Peggy Morrissey June 9, 1972 and they are still married.  They adopted two sons at birth: Thomas, born 9/16/84 and Patrick, born 5/9/85.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His career includes on the job training in all the basics of vocational rehabilitation at the Jewish Vocational Center (4 years), eventually becoming liason to Northwestern's Psychiatric Institute where they became aware of The Thresholds---psycho-social rehabilitation of chronically mentally ill adults (8 years) He was then made Vocational Coordinator at the central location, Clinical Director of the South Branch (47th &amp; Halsted), Assistant Director of the South Branch, and Director of the South Branch.

Coffield &amp; Associates (10 years) and has operated his own firm for the past four years.  He also taught "Counseling and Negotiations" at The John Marshall Law School for ten years.

&lt;p&gt;
On October 9, 2006 he had a triple bypass operation at Rush Presbyterian Hospital.  On October 10, 2006 at 8:15 am. and again at 10:15 am. he died.  Although he has not yet pursued obtaining his complete medical records of the event, he was told he was gone the first time for 6 minutes and the second time for 13 minutes.  His death experience happened the same way both times and he is bound to describe "it" to anyone who is willing to listen.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"IT" is immediate, "IT" is painless, "IT" teaches us about our souls, "IT" was an incredible celebration, "IT" was a life review and for him, "IT" depended on his answer to one question repeated at every step of his life review...A question extraordinarily simple yet more than a little complex. Join us to find out what "IT" was!

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Ayleyaell </title>
    <date>2010-02-13</date>
    <subtitle>2 NDEs; Gifted healer from San Diego</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Ayleyaell is a certified SHEN Therapist, Rubenfeld Synergist and Flower Essence Practitioner, who has a heart-centered healing practice, and uses shen energy and trained, refined chi, also known as qi, or prana, to assist her clients to relax and release physical and emotional pain held in their bodies.   She has also done advanced training with Dr. Eric Pearl and offers The Reconnection and Reconnective Healing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From childhood on, Alyeyaell considered herself to have been fortunate to meet, be mentored by and study with some of the very best teachers in a wide range of traditions and cultures. She is the daughter of a psychologist, Sol Froshnider, and a registered nurse, NDEr Betty Esthelle, who became a psychotherapist, orchestrated her own spontaneous remission of cancer, and developed the healing modality &lt;i&gt;Body Enlightenment. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Background: Ayleyaell is a graduate of Ilana Rubenfeld's very first training in Rubenfeld Synergy (then called Gestalt Synergy). She taught for Arica Institute; practiced Tai Chi with Fred Lehrman; walked the high Sierras studying flower essences with the founders of the FES, Richard Katz and Patricia Kaminski; rebirthed with Leonard Orr at Walden and Campbell Hot Springs; was initiated into Magnified Healing by Lady Master Kwan Yin and Asha; and breathed and prayed the ho'oponopono with Sondra Ray.   She traveled to China twice with her Taoist master Sifu Share K. Lew, who is a youthful 92.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ayleyaell's two Near-Death Experiences gave her an understanding of how a physical body becomes contracted and how to access the energy and compassion to release and transform pain into wisdom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her name is pronounced "&amp;#256; - Lee - Elle." It is a name that began as a humming in her bones during meditation in 1994. Over the next few weeks the humming grew more distinct when she meditated until she heard the syllables Ayleyaell clearly and shared her experience with one of her spiritual teachers who told her it is the sound of her essence. It is now her legal name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Healing sessions with Ayleyaell will be available on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, February 14, 15, and 16. $125/hr. Call Chicago IANDS at 847.251.5758 for an appointment.

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Ellena Lieberman</title>
    <date>2010-03-13</date>
    <subtitle>Author, Reader and Respected Teacher of Akashic Records, and Talented Singer...</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Ellena Lynn Lieberman has been a dedicated teacher and consultant of the Akashic Records for almost twenty years.  She follows the lineage of Mary Dean Parker whom she considers her spiritual teacher.  On the evening after the first day of the class, Ellena was so inspired by the unprecedented amount of unconditional  love and light from the Akashic Realms that she rushed home and declared to her husband: &amp;#8220;This is for me!&amp;#8221; Her heart awakening has led her to ever deepening development and exploration of what it means to attune to the level of the Akashic Record of oneself and others.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, she and her physical sister, Roni Reisler, are the only teachers directly asked in 1991-1992 to begin teaching by Mary Parker. After intensive inner work and cultivating a life changing love of the Akashic Records, Mary simultaneously selected them because the two held a balanced energy together, filled with love and support. They journeyed through many locales and worlds.   Since that time, a number of teachers have developed from the early classes taught by them throughout the USA, Argentina, and Curacao (Dutch Antilles.)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Ellena is a founding member of Akashic Record Consultants International and continues as a member of the board.  She has appeared on television in Argentina which aired throughout South America and Miami, interviewed for El Mismo Magazine in Argentina as well as a well-known journal in Japan, and on many spiritual radio shows in the States. She has been a presenter and guest speaker for the annual conference of Akashic Record Consultant&amp;#8217;s International for many years as well as other spiritual and religious organizations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ellena considers it a great blessing to have received so many testimonials about her devotion to her teaching and consulting practice.  Here are just a few:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;I feel so incredibly blessed to have met you, so incredibly blessed.  My soul is overcome with gratitude, my heart with uncommon joy&amp;#8230;Hope and Purpose are now imbued with the Holy Spirit.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;Chicago

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Your insights into the Records were expressed beautifully and eloquently.  Thank you for your generous spirit and good work.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;New York
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Many wonderful feelings are emerging since we spoke although they are difficult to put into words right now-I am so grateful for your gifts.  Thank you from my whole heart.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;Louisiana
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Ellena teaches and works with integrity and sensitivity.  She is vigilant and steadfast in her approach, yet freely and creatively allows the class to reach its natural energetic level ...  When she sees fragmentation in the energy, she works to re-establish grounding and connection to the higher vibrations&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;Chicago
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;Thank you for your diligence and sensitivity in bringing forth what has been &amp;#8220;concealed.&amp;#8221;  This has given new meaning and momentum to my life&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;Chicago
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In her new book, &lt;i&gt;The Principles of Dynamic Manifestation as received through the Akashic Records&lt;/i&gt;, she unites her knowledge of spirit, tone and &amp;#8220;supernal&amp;#8221; heart as she weaves the spiritual template of abundance on all levels. &amp;#8220;(The book)&amp;#8230;does a fine job of examining the processes that readers can apply to their own lives to raise their awareness and grow spiritually, physically, emotionally, and financially, and gain new insight and compassion through grace and God&amp;#8217;s love&amp;#8230.  It presents a great deal of information...and the individual chapters transition seamlessly from one topic to the next&amp;#8230.  Your writing style successfully serves to bring exceptional clarity to what is a complex subject.&amp;#8221; (Booksurge commentary)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Simultaneously with her spiritual calling, Ellena has created and performs a concert series &amp;#8220;A Golden Treasury of Vintage Songs&amp;#8221; in Florida, Chicago, and New York. Trained in classical voice and acting, she is noted for her warm engaging stage presence, professionalism, and rich Soprano voice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Private  one hour Akashic consultations with Ellena will be available on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, March 14, 15, and 16. $125/hr. Call Chicago IANDS at 847.251.5758 for an appointment.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  John St. Augustine </title>
    <date>2010-04-10</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Author, Talk Radio Host and Motivational Speaker, Senior Producer, The Dr. Oz Show, Oprah Radio</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
John St. Augustine has been called &amp;#8220;the new voice of America&amp;#8221; by veteran broadcaster Charles Osgood and &amp;#8220;the most influential voice on radio&amp;#8221; by best-selling author Cheryl Richardson. Thousands of Midwest listeners tuned in daily to hear John&amp;#8217;s view on world events and to engage themselves in his conversations with today&amp;#8217;s leaders and heroes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His talk radio show was created with one underlying goal - to make sure listeners have access to information that would not only entertain but also inspire them to a greater life experience.
&lt;/p&gt;


 John&amp;#8217;s talent behind the microphone has lead to numerous broadcasting awards including three Michigan Association of Broadcasters &amp;#8220;Best Talk Host&amp;#8221; awards. Since the inception of his radio talk show in 1997, he has broadcast over 7500 programs and interviewed over 5,000 people from all walks of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In July 2006, John ended his Radio Results network show when the opportunity arose to become a producer with Oprah &amp; Friends for XM Satellite Radio. He also is the creator of the syndicated &amp;#8220;Powerthoughts&amp;#8221; one-minute vignettes. Since 1999, over 3,000 of these inspirational and thought provoking commentaries have aired nationally.  Beginning September 25, 2006. &amp;#8220;Powerthoughts for Living an Uncommon Life&amp;#8221; will be heard on Oprah &amp; Friends on XM Satellite Radio.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

He is the author of &lt;i&gt; Living an Uncommon Life: Essential Lessons from 21 Extraordinary People&lt;/i&gt; (Hampton Roads, October, 2006)  and  &lt;i&gt;Every Moment Matters&lt;/i&gt;, to be released in January, 2010.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

St. Augustine is also a sought-after speaker on human potential and purpose.  An inspirational and gifted communicator, he has presented his message of hope and possibility to over 500,000 people via his keynotes and seminars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 While St. Augustine is proud of his many media awards and accolades, he cites his 2002 kidney donation to his daughter Amanda as his greatest achievement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

John and his wife, Jackie, have two teenagers, Amanda and Andrew. They divide their time between their homes in Michigan&amp;#8217;s Upper Peninsula and Chicago.

&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Peter Sterling</title>
    <date>2010-05-08</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Celtic harpist, Shaman, Peter Sterling brings the music of his heavenly experience to us.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Peter Sterling had a near-death experience which was self-induced. He took more of a Shamanic route, using sacred substances in ritual and ceremony to induce a transcendent deathlike state where he left his body and was taken up into the Light, and where he met the Angels and God directly! They told him he was to go back and to be a channel for the heavenly music which he was hearing and which permeated everything in a glorious sound of oneness and Divine Love. This is the source of his music.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There have been timeless musicians throughout history whose hands seem to be guided by unseen forces. Possessing unexplainable musical genius, the exquisite beauty of their songs have delighted and mystified audiences the world over, somehow connecting us closer to heaven.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peter Sterling is one such musical treasure. A harpist of world-class skill, Peter's eclectic music continues to touch the lives of thousands around the world. Devoted listeners over the years have consistently reported greater peace, spiritual visions, and even miraculous healings while listening to Peter's heavenly albums, suggesting the astonishing potential of his uncanny musical gifts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A precious few can claim the musical foundations that led Peter to play the harp. His unusual and inspiring story truly began during a series of life-altering divine encounters while living outdoors in the peaceful solitude of Sedona, Arizona's Red Rock canyons. Spending countless hours at its sacred vortex sites practicing yoga and meditation amidst the brilliant scenery and vast silence, Peter one day experienced a genuine spiritual vision of angelic beings in a heavenly choir surrounding him. In this profound vision, Peter saw himself strumming a harp and allowing divine music to flow through him. Although Peter showed considerable musical talent as a child, having played the piano by ear and then dabbling with the flute and guitar over the years, music had not been a prevalent part of his life. Overwhelmed by the grandeur of this angelic experience, Peter waited for the next series of synchronicities to guide his choices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Only a week later, Peter happened to meet an accomplished harpist who was selling a Celtic harp. Quickly acquiring the instrument and receiving one brief music lesson, Peter retreated back to the canyons where he humbly beseeched the heavens atop a red rock peak to allow the music of the harp to flow through him. Almost immediately his prayers were answered as he began to instinctively strum chords and simple melodies. "It was as if my hands knew what to do," Peter said. It wasn't long before the beginning melodies matured into distinct songs, closely resembling the heavenly tones he once heard among the silence of the canyons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Incredibly, Peter recorded his first album, Harp Magic, after a mere ten months with the harp, demonstrating a skill-level most experts would consider impossible after such a brief time. Nevertheless, this is the "magic" of Peter's remarkable story. Harp Magic went on to be nominated for the "Naird Indie Award" for best string album of 1994--a national honor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2004, Peter's cd "Harp Dream's" went to #1 on the N.A.R. top 100 radio playlist for 8 weeks making it the most played new age music cd in the United States, Canada and Europe. And was then nominated for "Album of the Year" by the same organization! As a result Peter signed with the prestigious record label "Real Music" for the world wide release of his CD "Shadow,Mist and Light". His earlier celestial sounds have evolved into a contemporary instrumental mix of world fusion, with an impressive advancement in his melodies complexity, groove, and inspirational quality, sounding at once seductive, hip, and angelic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peter's music continues to broaden in its appeal. Offering flavors of jazz, classical, world music, and New Age styles, Peter's music can be as rhythmic as it is healing. Peter tours extensively, performing his unique style of harp music to appreciative audiences the world over.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Betty Esthelle</title>
    <date>2010-06-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; RN; 83 yrs. young; Healer; healed self from cancer; amazing inspirational woman from Portland, OR, area.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Betty Esthelle, RN, 82 years young as of April 25, 2009, is a registered nurse who became a psychotherapist, then a healer, then a teacher of healers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1984, as a result of her involvement in healing herself after a diagnosis of lymphoma and a near death experience, Betty re-named her work and originated Body Enlightenment. Betty was able to induce a spontaneous remission and has been cancer free since 1986.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While Body Enlightenment has helped many people and can be learned by everyone, graduates of Betty's 3 year professional certification program up to now have been exclusively medical doctors, psychologists and psychotherapists, all in Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Betty's unique, creative, gentle approach includes expertise in hands-on deep healing and profound transformation of trauma into wisdom, inner child healing with resolution and empowerment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Betty is well trained in both traditional medicine and esoteric healing. Among the teachers and methods she has studied are: Oscar Ichazo, Taoist Grand Master Share K Lew, Ilana Rubenfeld, Rabbi Zalman Schacter-Shalomi, Leonard Orr, Moshe Feldenkrais, Native American traditions, dance, art, movement, nutrition, shamanism, biofield therapeutics, Gestalt therapy, and other healing modalities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
St. Germain of The Ascended Masters calls her the "Grand Dame of Healing," and Chief Joseph honors and sponsors her work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Betty relocated to Vancouver, WA in 1999 from San Francisco to be nearer her 3 grandchildren.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It has been said that a session with Betty is magical and transformational - every time.  We are working to make private sessions available.  More info to come about this.

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Phyllis Tickle</title>
    <date>2010-07-10</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Editor of Religion Dept of PUBLISHERS WEEKLY; authority on religion in America.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
PHYLLIS TICKLE, founding editor of the Religion Department of PUBLISHERS WEEKLY, the international journal of the book industry, is frequently quoted in print sources like USA TODAY, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, NY TIMES as well as in electronic media like PBS, NPR, THE HALLMARK CHANNEL, and innumerable blogs and web sites.  Tickle is an authority on religion in America and a much sought after lecturer on the subject.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to lectures and numerous essays, articles, and interviews, Tickle is the author of over two dozen books in religion and spirituality, most recently The Great Emergence, How Christianity is Changing and Why and The Words of Jesus, A Gospel of the Sayings of Our Lord.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She is also the author of the notable and popular The Divine Hours series of manuals for observing fixed-hour prayer: The Divine Hours &amp;#8211; Prayers for Summertime, The Divine Hours &amp;#8211; Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime, The Divine Hours &amp;#8211; Prayers for Springtime, Eastertide - Prayers for Lent Through Easter from The Divine Hours, and Christmastide &amp;#8211; Prayers for Advent through Epiphany from The Divine Hours (Doubleday); The Night Offices from The Divine Hours and The Pocket Edition of The Divine Hours (Oxford University Press); and This Is What I Pray Today &amp;#8211; The Divine Hours  Prayers for Children (Dutton)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tickle, who was with PUBLISHERS WEEKLY until her retirement in 2004, began her career as a college teacher and, for almost ten years, served as academic dean to the Memphis College of Art before entering full time into writing and publishing. In September 1996 she received the Mays Award, one of the book industry's most prestigious awards for lifetime achievement in writing and publishing, and specifically in recognition of her work in gaining mainstream media coverage of religion publishing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2007 she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Christy Awards "In gratitude for a lifetime as an advocate for fiction written to the glory of God."  In 2004, she received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from the Berkeley School of Divinity at Yale University. In 2009 she received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from North Park University.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 1955, Tickle had a Near-Death Experience which enhanced her considerable ability to objectively observe the world around her and also lead to the acquisition of Lawrence, a friendly ghost who helped raise her seven children and provided help and inspiration to remember that things unseen are just as real as those that are visible.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tickle is a founding member of The Canterbury Roundtable, and serves now, as she has in the past, on a number of advisory and corporate boards. A lay eucharistic minister and lector in the Episcopal Church, she is the mother of seven children and, with her physician-husband, makes her home on a small farm in Lucy, Tennessee.

    <title>Near-Death Movies</title>
    <date>2010-08-14</date>
    <subtitle>Two Fabulous Full-length Feature Films.  Bring your popcorn...no intermission.  First movie begins promptly at 2 pm.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to a wonderful afternoon of mystical fun!
Both of these movies are entertaining and informative...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE (2008)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A very well done near-death experience brings to life a woman who comes back with the ability to see ghosts after her NDE.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Amy Acker is the top talent in this LMN flick, with Johanna Nutter and James A. Woods (among others) ably embodying the supporting characters. Acker is Ellie, a woman who has the "near death experience" from the get-go. After awakening in the hospital, she soon realizes she brought something back with her from her brush with death...something that frightens her and simultaneously lends her power to get people heard...dead people, that is.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

WHAT ON EARTH? (2009)...winner &amp;#8220;Best Feature Documentary&amp;#8221; at the 2009 UFO Congress Film Festival

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Intricate designs in crops turn up in farmers&amp;#8217; fields overnight.   Although they have appeared throughout the world for many years, no one knows where they come from or why they arrive.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 For fifteen years, Suzanne Taylor has been part of a lively community of visionary artists, scientist, philosophers, geometers and farmers who are drawn to England by the circles every summer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

This 81-minute feature documentary tracks her interactions with these &amp;#8220;croppies&amp;#8221; as they go circle-chasing, indulge in circle-analysis, and share why they are so fascinated by the phenomenon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

It also deals with how our scientific materialistic worldview hampers serious investigation of a great mystery of our time, and how knowing the circles come from another intelligence would help us think as a planet to solve the problems that challenge us now...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;

&amp;#8220;At all costs, don&amp;#8217;t miss What on Earth?   It deals intelligently with the globe&amp;#8217;s most persistent and beautiful mystery, the crop circles.   If you have an inkling of adventure and even a small opening of curiosity, you will savor this lovely voyage into the realms of the magnificent and our human relationship with it.&amp;#8221;  ~Jay Levin, Founder and former Editor in Chief, LosAngeles Weekly
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"One of the most magnificent, startlingly brilliant DVDs on the phenomenon ever produced.  Incredibly beautiful and powerful." ~Whitley Strieber

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Roni Reisler</title>
    <date>2010-09-11</date>
    <subtitle>Akashic Records Reader and Teacher;  Mandala Artist and Teacher</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
The Artist  Roni Reisler has studied fiber and textile arts at the Art institute of Chicago and-painting
with art critic Franz Schulz at Lake Forest College. She worked as a fabric and accessories
designer for Sansappelle in Chicago and has maintained her own business studio,
Magnificent Monkey, constructing bridal headpieces, beadwork, jewelry, and interior wall hangings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

In 1990 Roni, with her sister, had the good fortune to attend a workshop on accessing the
Akashic Records taught by Mary Parker. This particular meditation technique centers on
using a simple Holy Prayer which is the key to allow information to come through while the
reader is still present and conscious. To Roni, it meant that it is possible to consciously
and deliberately tap into Divine Source while working on creative projects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;



This new information changed her life. Roni's sister, Ellena Lieberman, was spiritually
called to teach the Akashic Records method to others and Roni chose to dedicate herself
as her sister's facilitator. Together, they have traveled in North and South America
conducting workshops. The technique has served them both as an exquisite tool to
heighten and deepen each of their Spiritual Paths.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

When she discovered Dr. Judith Cornell's book, Mandala, Luminous Symbols for Healing,
Roni was enlightened to how she could integrate her sense of color and design with her
Spiritual Path. She shared her realization with her Akashic Records teacher at a retreat in
Texas. Mary encouraged Roni's idea to open the Records for guidance to construct
Mandalas. Mary scrounged for some paper and colored pencils and directed Roni to "sit down and do it!"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the next four days, Roni created five Mandalas. The energy was so strong and
magnificent that she was certain this is the Path to and from her heart.
Within the following months Roni flew to the Santa`Cruz Mountains in California to attend
an intensive Mandala workshop with Dr. Cornell. She continues her studies and exploration
of Mandalas and symbology on a daily basis. Roni is certain that at this interval in the &#xB7;
continuum, Mandalas are part of her Path. Some of Roni's Mandalas have been exhibited at
the A.R.C. Gallery Education Foundation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Roni  has also been a Certified Akashic Record Consultant and Teacher for 15 years. She has
been trained through the Spiritual Lineage of Akashic Record Consultant International by Mary D.
Parker, and is one of the original teachers. Roni has taught and given consultations all over
the United States, Canada, and in South America. She sits on the Board of Akashic Record
Consultants International, a not-for-profit organization, as Chairperson of Ethics and Standards.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Thank you so much...it is beautiful and I can 't wait to get it framed and up in its place of honor... &lt;/i&gt;
M.D. - Cicero, IL
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I LOVE IT! You are a gracious, talented, special woman...&lt;/i&gt; M. W., Jacksonville, FL
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It's stunning! Thanks. I'm amazed at your work. Worth the wait, for sure. &lt;/i&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Peter Shockey</title>
    <date>2011-02-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Acclaimed film-maker and screenwriter...We will show his award-winning video, LIFE AFTER LIFE, during the first half of the meeting.  Please be there at 2 pm sharp!</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;

Peter Shockey is the producer, director &amp; writer of LIFE AFTER LIFE.  His own true story of how he responded to his father's terminal diagnosis became the narrative for the film, in which Peter appears as himself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shockey has been a filmmaker for over twenty-five years, a talent he discovered immediately following a profound &amp; personal spiritual encounter. He has enjoyed a long history of writing &amp; producing TV productions and uplifting books. Early in his career, his interest in visionary spiritual topics led to a trademark style of animated special-FX cinematography. Guideposts magazine nicknamed his work "Heavenly Visions for Earthly Eyes" (article).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His highly rated documentary &lt;i&gt;Life After Life&lt;/i&gt;, which appeared on Discovery's TLC, won a New York Film Festival award for its sensitively written exploration of the near-death experience. It was distributed internationally and translated into a dozen languages. His next project for TLC was &lt;i&gt;Angel Stories - Parts 1 &amp; 2,&lt;/i&gt; which investigated contemporary accounts of angelic activity.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In addition to high ratings, &lt;i&gt;Angel Stories&lt;/i&gt; sold over 60,000 videos through the Reader's Digest video catalog. Following the stepping-stones of popular interest in spiritual topics, TLC commissioned two more programs entitled &lt;i&gt;Stories of Miracles - 1 &amp; 2,&lt;/i&gt; which surpassed the successful ratings of the previous shows. He subsequently wrote, produced and directed the Hallmark Channel series, &lt;i&gt;Miracles, Angels &amp; Afterlife.&lt;/i&gt; Peter has associate produced several other documentaries, all in the inspirational genre.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peter's film work depicting the near-death experience has appeared on Oprah, which accompanied the interview with Betty Eadie, writer of &lt;i&gt;Embraced By The Light.&lt;/i&gt; Oprah also touted Shockey's book &lt;i&gt;Reflections Of Heaven&lt;/i&gt; in a show about miracles, featuring one of the amazing stories in the book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Peter is a seasoned talk-show guest, who has been interviewed on CBN's The 700 CLUB, and many other television and radio talk shows. He has served as a guest lecturer on the topics of miracles, angels and afterlife experiences for National Hospice Organization and other organizations and churches. Peter and his wife Stowe are raw food advocates, and co-wrote the book &lt;i&gt;The Hallelujah Diet,&lt;/i&gt; which hit Amazon #1 in the spring of 2006.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Shockey's TV investigations led to his Doubleday inspirational hardcover &lt;i&gt;Reflections Of Heaven,&lt;/i&gt; opening the door to a new genre of inspirational writing---bridging the gap between the traditional CBA sector and the mass-market body, mind &amp; spirit sector. He and his wife Stowe also co-authored a second Doubleday book; &lt;i&gt;Journey Of Light: Stories of Dawn after Darkness,&lt;/i&gt; released February 2007.

    <title>Reincarnation Movies:  True stories of stunning reincarnation events.</title>
    <date>2011-03-12</date>
    <subtitle>You chose the videos!  Now here they are!  </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
We will show some powerful videos which support the belief in Reincarnation.  We took a vote at the last meeting and the most interest was shown in the story of the little boy from LA, James Leininger, who was born with memories of his past-life as a WW II fighter pilot.   His story has the most credible proof of all reincarnation stories ever!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A close second was the story of Jenny Cockell, the woman from England who was born with memories of being a mother of 8 who died in Ireland in 1932.   She had intimate, personal memories of all the children and when she grew up, she found them, now in their seventies and eighties, and reconnected with them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As it turned out, we will have the best of both.....Bruce Leininger, the father of James, will be our speaker in May, 2011, and we will show the full-length movie, Yesterday's Children, which stars Jane Seymour as Jenny Cockell, in March.....along with some footage of the real-life Jenny Cockell and her children and James Leininger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We will not serve refreshments in March, because of the tight schedule.   However, you may bring your own.  This is a  "BYOR"  "Bring Your Own Refreshments" (no alcohol, please) meeting.  We will begin promptly at 2 pm and go for 3 hours.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please do not leave any trash in the auditorium.   We are profoundly grateful for this beautiful space for our meetings, and we do not want to do anything to jeopardize our status.   Thank you for your cooperation.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Randolph J. Rogers</title>
    <date>2011-04-09</date>
    <subtitle>"His book, THE KEY OF LIFE, is a consciousness-raising self-help detective story that can lead you to examine the everyday details of your life." ~Peter Michalos, Author of Psyche, a Novel of the Young Freud, (Nan A Talese, Doubleday)

 </subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;

Randy Rogers is the president of Telefilm, Inc., a Los Angeles-based production company handling the promotion of Hollywood blockbusters like &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;
, &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter, Pearl Harbor, Batman, Superman, Shrek&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/i&gt;.A career spanning four decades in newspapers, television and motion pictures&amp;#8212;working for and with such companies as NBC News,Disney,Warner Bros., Paramount,Universal Pictures, MGM, Lionsgate, Sony and DreamWorks&amp;#8212;has earned him several Emmy nominations and numerous press club awards.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;



Growing up in Johnstown, a western Pennsylvania steel town, Randy began his lifelong path as a photographer when he asked for his first camera from a Green Stamps catalog on his 10th birthday. His first job, that of a part-time usher at the State Theatre in 1969, subtly foretold where that path would be heading. From that day forward, his real career would be in the news and motion picture businesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Starting with a newspaper internship at Johnstown&amp;#8217;s Tribune-Democrat during the summer of 1970, Randy progressed to television news cinematographer with WJAC-TV the day after his high school graduation in 1971. Two years later, he headed west, spending thirteen years in Phoenix, Arizona, beginning with KPHO-TV and moving to KPNX-TV, the local NBC affiliate, picking up the Emmy nominations and press club awards along the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Randy&amp;#8217;s career was a fast-moving escalator whisking him to the top of his field. His baptism in the pool of metaphysics began with breakfast on the morning of April 23, 1986, when he read this horoscope to his wife: What seemed a &amp;#8220;no exit&amp;#8221; proposition will be brighter. You will have more love and money as result. Get ready for new start. Display pioneering spirit. &amp;#8220;Maybe the network is going to call me today,&amp;#8221; he jokingly prophesied to her and then left for the office. An hour later, as he walked into the newsroom, the receptionist handed him a phone message: NBC News was calling to offer him a job!

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;The Key of Life  has changed my beliefs about life and death forever. I met Randy on Aug. 23rd and my father passed away just a few weeks later, on Sept. 14th. This book eased my pain so much during this difficult time. And I could not believe the significance of these dates with those in the book! If you have ever even thought about the possibility of reincarnation, you must read this book. &amp;#8220; &lt;/i&gt; ~Trudy Clarke, Butte MT
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;I approached Randy&amp;#8217;s metaphysical exploration with interest. There were a few surprises at the outset, the first being that I liked reading The Key of Life (there were &amp;#8216;good books&amp;#8217; on the NY Times bestseller list I didn&amp;#8217;t necessarily like). The next surprise wasn&amp;#8217;t so much a surprise as it was a confirmation when I discovered that Randy&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;hands-on&amp;#8217; testimonial to the existence of higher fields of influence would be absorbing and genuine even to the hard-core disbeliever. For as far out and high up as the death of an old friend took him, the surer it was that his budding bond with that higher spirit would lead him home to perception and resolution. Whatever hell Randy Rogers had to cross to reach his heavenly cause, he took us with him, round trip. And this reader felt the better for it.&amp;#8221; &lt;/i&gt; ~Shirley Jones, actress



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;



&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;The Key of Life: A Metaphysical Investigation&amp;#8230; is a very personal and life changing experience. We emerge from it&amp;#8230; enlightened and inspired. Congratulations, what an accomplishment!&amp;#8221; &lt;/i&gt; ~Maria Shriver, First Lady of CA, Author of Just Who Will You Be?: Big Question, Little Book. Answer Within.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;The Key of Life is a frank, insightful chronicle of one man's spiritual odyssey. Everyone can relate in some way to his experiences. We may interpret them differently, yet Randy's ability to pull us in and share his drama takes us, in fact, to the same spiritual home.&amp;#8221;  &lt;/i&gt;~Lynda Neff, West Virginia

    <title>Guest Speaker:  David Kessler</title>
    <date>2011-06-11</date>
    <subtitle>Author; One of the most renowned experts on death and grief in the world</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
David Kessler is one of the most renowned experts on death and grief and in the field of hospice and end-of-life care today, as a result of reaching hundreds of thousands of people through his books.  His newest book is &lt;i&gt;Visions, Trips, &amp; Crowded Rooms,&lt;/i&gt; which is considered the #1 Spirituality book in the USA.  In this fascinating book, David brings stunning stories from the bedsides of the dying that will educate, enlighten, and comfort us all.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
He co-authored two bestsellers with the legendary Elisabeth K&amp;uuml;bler-Ross:&lt;i&gt; On Grief and Grieving&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Life Lessons&lt;/i&gt;. (David was honored to have been at Elisabeth&amp;#8217;s bedside during her passing.) His first book, &lt;i&gt;The Needs of the Dying,&lt;/i&gt; a #1 best-selling hospice book, received praise by Mother Teresa.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
His services have been used by Elizabeth Taylor, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Marianne Williamson when their loved ones faced life-challenging illnesses. He also worked with late actors Anthony Perkins and Michael Landon and industrialist Armand Hammer when they faced their own deaths.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
David has helped thousands of men, women and children face life and death with peace, dignity and courage. His experiences have taken him from the Auschwitz concentration camp to Mother Teresa's Home for the Dying Destitute in Calcutta.
&lt;p.
&lt;/p&gt;
David&amp;#8217;s work has been featured on CNN, NBC, PBS, and Entertainment Tonight; and he has been interviewed on Oprah &amp; Friends. He has been discussed in the New York Times; and has written for the Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Wall Street Journal, and Anderson Cooper 360&amp;deg;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He is no stranger to disaster and trauma. He has often worked with the loss and grief of mass casualties, volunteering his services as a member of the Red Cross's Aviation Disaster team (the Aspen plane crash) and as a Special Reserve Police Officer for the Los Angeles Police Department's trauma team.  He works with the next of kin as well as survivors (e.g.the Singapore Airlines crash).
&lt;p.
&lt;/p&gt;
In addition to his expertise in grief and loss, the Red Cross and the Los Angeles Police Department have trained him for the most critical, tragic and horrific situations possible, which of course included 9/11, and Ground Zero.
&lt;p.
&lt;/p&gt;
David takes his experiences and turns them into inspiring and motivational lectures for audiences around the world. He also teaches therapists, doctors and nurses on grief and loss and leads a support group for people with cancer. David is a certified trainer through the American Medical Association/EPEC program (EPEC- Education for Professionals on End of life Care). &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
In his daily work he is Director of Palliative Care for Citrus Valley Health Partners, which has three hospitals and home hospice as well as a freestanding in-patient hospice unit in the Los Angeles area with over 900 physicians and 2,000 nurses.
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Anthony Cicoria, MD</title>
    <date>2011-07-09</date>
    <subtitle>Doctor, struck by lightning, has NDE and comes back as a pianist and composer.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Tony Cicoria, a full time practicing board-certified Orthopedic Surgeon, is Chief of Orthopedics at Chenango Memorial Hospital, Norwich, New York, and Clinical Assistant Professor of Orthopedics at SUNY Upstate Medical School, in Syracuse.  He received his BS in Biology from The Citadel and is a graduate of the Medical University of South Carolina (MD, PhD) and the University of Virginia Orthopedic Surgery Residency.  He lives in Oneonta, New York and has three children in college.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Dr. Cicoria&amp;#8217;s musical career began rather remarkably when he was struck by lightning in 1994 while speaking on a public telephone during a family reunion near Albany, N.Y.  He was resuscitated by a nurse waiting to use the phone.  Shortly thereafter, music started coming to him &amp;#8230;first in a dream, some of which ultimately contributed to the original compositions featured in his programs and on CD.  Dr. Cicoria self-taught from 1995-1997 before starting formal music instruction with Sandra (Campbell) McKane in 1998.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a result of his unusual introduction to the world of music, Dr. Cicoria was featured in the New Yorker Magazine article A Bolt from the Blue, by Oliver Sacks MD, as well as in Dr. Sacks&amp;#8217; book Musicophilia:  Tales of Music and the Brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Tony has given mini-recitals at the Sonata Adult Music Camp, in Bennington, Vermont, under the direction of Polly Van der Linde, where he has played Chopin&amp;#8217;s Military Polonaise, op. 40 (in 2002), Chopin&amp;#8217;s Fantasie Impromptu (in 2003), Brahms&amp;#8217; Rhapsody, op. 79, no. 2 (in 2005), Chopin&amp;#8217;s Scherzo in B flat Minor, op. 31 (in 2006) and an early version of his own Lightning Sonata in 2007.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
January 29, 2008 marked a significant milestone in Dr. Cicoria&amp;#8217;s musical career&amp;#8230;his public debut at the Goodrich Theater in Oneonta, New York, presented by the Catskill Conservatory in association with the SUNY at Oneonta, assisted by a grant from the NYS Council on the Arts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 His performance was recorded live by the BBC-1, Granada Media UK, and German National Television.  Besides The New Yorker Magazine, he has been profiled in numerous magazines including, Vital Signs, The Week, Financial Times UK, Superconsciousness Magazine, and has had television presentations on Canada&amp;#8217;s The Hour, BBC-1&amp;#8217;s documentary Imagine, Granada Media&amp;#8217;s  documentary My Strange Brain, WSKG  Expressions, Quarks and Company German Television, PBS&amp;#8217;s  NOVA:  Musical Minds,  and The Musical Instinct,  SupremeMaster TV, The Discovery Channel, ITTV,  and other soon to be released interviews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Tony recently released his original works in his first CD entitled, &amp;#8220;Notes from an Accidental Pianist&amp;#8221; through    CDBaby.com.   He  is also working on several other solo piano pieces, a 4-hand/2-piano piece, a symphony based on Brahms' Variation, op. 9, a concerto, and is also writing a book detailing the origin of his musical experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tony&amp;#8217;s teacher and mentor, Sandra (Campbell) McKane, began piano instruction at age eight with renowned pianists Gaby, Jean and Robert Casadesus, who became primary influences in her formative years.  Their tutelage began in the United States and continued in France, where Sandy spent several summers studying with them, both at Fontainebleau Academy, near Paris, and the Ravel Academy, in Ciboure, France.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At age 15, Sandy began instruction with Sasha Gorodnitzki and earned her bachelors and masters degrees in music at the Juilliard School.  In addition, she taught ear-training in the Juilliard Pre-College Division for 10 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988, she joined the music department faculty at Hartwick College and chaired the department from 2002-06.  She has been offering private instruction to students of all levels for over twenty years.  Her primary teaching focus has been the development of musical literacy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Inspired by the outcome of Charlotte&amp;#8217;s Circle, a parent-child service learning model, Sandy has most recently directed her creative energies toward the development of a K-12 service learning model, working with community-based organizations and teachers in the Oneonta City School District.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  B.  Anne Gehman</title>
    <date>2011-08-13</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, Married to former Jesuit Priest, Certified medium - one of 100 top psychics in the US, Spiritualist Minister, worked with Dr. Gary Schwartz at the U of AZ.</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
The Rev. B. Anne Gehman began having psychic experiences as a child. Raised in a Mennonite family, she left home at age 14 to finish her schooling. A life-changing near-death experience led Anne to develop her natural gifts, including the ability to predict future events. She became the youngest person to be certified by the National Spiritualist Association of Churches (NSAC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rev. Gehman has a NSAC National Spiritualist Teacher (NST) degree and she is a Certified Medium, a Commissioned Healer, and a NSAC appointed Missionary. She has served on the NSAC Board of Trustees, and presently serves on the Board of the Morris Pratt Institute. She was elected to the International Congress of Parapsychologist and Paraphysics in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her work has taken her throughout South America, India, Bhutan, the U.K., Australia, Canada and the U.S.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Rev. Gehman has gained international attention for her help in solving crimes, locating oil and missing persons, healing illnesses, and connecting family members with their loved ones in spirit. She has worked with top government agencies and officials, police departments, judges, and corporate CEOs, as well as numerous other individuals from all walks of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She has been written about in over 38 books, notably in Jess Stearn&amp;#8217;s books, &lt;i&gt;Adventures in the Psychic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Miracle Workers&lt;/i&gt;, and Harold Sherman&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;You Can Communicate with the Unseen World.&lt;/i&gt; She is also listed among the top 100 psychics in the country, and has worked with the University of Arizona on a research study regarding after death communication, which is documented in the book, &lt;i&gt;After Life Experiments&lt;/i&gt; by Dr. Gary Schwartz and Linda Russek.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rev. Gehman was featured in the 2010 HBO movie entitled, &lt;i&gt;No One Dies in Lily Dale.&lt;/i&gt; Her life story is told in the recently published biography,  &lt;i&gt;The Priest and Medium&lt;/i&gt; written by Suzanne Giesemann, as well as the unauthorized biography entitled, &lt;i&gt;There Is a Purpose.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 While remarkable for her spiritual gifts and experiences, Anne's life is all the more fascinating due to an unusual twist: She is married to Wayne Knoll, Ph.D., a former Jesuit priest. A brilliant student devoted to his faith, Wayne also left home at 14 to join a Roman Catholic seminary. Even while living his life's dream as a professor of literature at Georgetown University, Wayne felt an emptiness that only a woman could fill. After more than a decade of religious training, he made the wrenching decision to leave the priesthood not knowing if he would find the love he sought.  Her biography, &lt;i&gt;The Priest and the Medium&lt;/i&gt;,  shares the remarkable story of two soul mates on parallel paths with divergent beliefs, yet united in their love for God and each other.

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Kenneth W. James, PhD</title>
    <date>2011-09-10</date>
    <subtitle>Jungian Psychoanalyst, will speak on Jung's view of the near-death experience, Asso Spiritualist minister, psychic medium</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Ken James is a diplomate Jungian psychoanalyst in private practice in Chicago, and the founder and director of The Soulwork Center.  The Soulwork Center is a Jungian-oriented resource center dedicated to facilitating the process of individuation as understood by the psychiatrist and philosopher C.G. Jung.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. James is also the Director of Student Services at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, where he coordinates all services for students with learning, emotional and behavioral needs from ages 3 years through senior year of high school.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to his psychoanalytic practice, he holds the rank of professor emeritus after a thirty-three year career as a university professor.   Ken received his Ph.D. from Northwestern University in 1975, and his diploma in Analytical Psychology from the C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago in 1993.  Ken did training in The Bonny Method of Guided Imagery and Music at the Institute for Consciousness and Music in Baltimore, Maryland in the late 1970s.  He also did four years of post-doctoral study in theology and scripture at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago&amp;#8217;s Hyde Park neighborhood in the early 1980s, and ended up teaching preaching there for a time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He studied vocal music at the American Conservatory of Music, and appeared at Zanie&amp;#8217;s Comedy Club, Court Theatre, and The Repertory Opera Theatre of Oak Park.   He also performed flamenco with the Ensemble Espa&amp;ntilde;ol, under the stage name Francisco Santos.  He has served on the faculty at Roosevelt University, Northeastern Illinois University, and Northwestern University. He has lectured and conducted workshops internationally on Divination and Synchronicity, Dream Interpretation, and The Tarot and its relationship to Jung&amp;#8217;s psychology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ken&amp;#8217;s spirituality draws from several sources.  He was raised Roman Catholic, but in a &amp;#8220;mixed home&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;his father was Episcopalian.  As he matured, his Catholicism was formed more fully by the Trappists, St. Francis and St. Clare of Assisi, and the Sisters of Saint Agnes.  As a child he would go with neighborhood friends to the Chicago Buddhist Temple, which at the time was around the corner from his home, and down the street from the Catholic church he attended with his family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He took lay ordination as a Zen Buddhist in 1995 under Roshi Richard Langlois of the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago.  Ken also became familiar with Judaism by attending services occasionally with his godfather&amp;#8217;s wife, who was Jewish.  Later, he studied the Kabbalah with the Lubavitcher Rabbi Meir Chai Benhiyoun of the Chabad of the Loop, Gold Coast and Lincoln Park.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Coming from a Scottish family (on his father&amp;#8217;s side) with several talented psychics going back several generations, Ken has always been comfortable with the intuitive dimension.  He realized that Carl Jung&amp;#8217;s teachings on the structure and dynamics of the psyche provided grounding and clarity on a personal level, and deep professional fulfillment as well.   Always eager to learn new things and walk new paths, around ten years ago Ken found his way to the oldest spiritualist church in Chicago, The Church of the Spirit, where he now serves as an assistant pastor and medium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ken&amp;#8217;s interest in near-death experiences stems from his practice.  Over the past twenty-five years, he has worked with several analysands who were experiencers before they began analysis, and other analysands had near-death experiences during the time that they were doing their analytic work with him.   Ken finds that Jung&amp;#8217;s psychology lends itself to a deeper understanding of near-death phenomena, possibly because of Jung&amp;#8217;s own near-death event.  Ken is particularly interested in the relationship between near-death experiences, spirituality, Jung's archetypes of the collective unconscious, and the practice of consciousness in daily life.

    <subtitle>Raise your vibes with some stunning videos...a wonderful afternoon of mystical fun, both entertaining and informative!

</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Two Fabulous Full-length Feature Films. Both of these movies are entertaining and informative...Bring your own popcorn...no intermission. First movie begins promptly at 2 pm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the September 10 Chicago IANDS meeting....130 in attendance...YOU chose the  two videos to be shown at the next meeting.  They are both excellent and hard to find...Amazon had only one copy of Beyond Death available...for $140, and several copies of Experiencing the Soul...for $85.  So better come to our meeting and see it for a relatively small donation.....
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
BEYOND DEATH - Mainstream researchers, mediums and those who have had near-death experiences help explore the eternal mystery of what awaits us when we die ***We are all destined to die, and there is no escape. But perhaps it is this inevitability that inspires us to continually seek answers to the question: WHAT HAPPENS BEYOND DEATH? This feature-length film explores the eternal enigma from every angle, meeting with everyone from mainstream scientific researchers to mediums in search of insight into what is in store for us. Skeptics detail their arguments. A dramatic and vivid counterpoint is provided by several people who have had near-death experiences, and their extraordinary tales are pointed to by others as proof that there is indeed another chapter to be written after we pass away. Probing and illuminating, this is an extraordinary journey into a realm that has captured the human imagination for millennia - the quest for the afterlife.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
EXPERIENCING THE SOUL ($65)
What is the soul? Although the word is dropped into conversation with a clockwork-like regularity, when pressed, most people struggle to define what they mean when referring to the soul. This compelling program aims to find out how we define the soul, speaking to 18 preeminent leaders in their respective fields of science, teaching, and spirituality, in an attempt to gain a broad overview of the subject. Some spooky revelations unfold, as the various experts talk of communicating with the dead, near-death experiences, and encounters with as-yet unborn entities. Fleshing out the footage, The Dalai Lama and other spiritual leaders offer some wise words, making this a fascinating collection of thoughts on an elusive subject.
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reviews for Experiencing the Soul from Amazon.com:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
1. I viewed the film as a rental (in fact, twice in one week, which is very rare for me) and appreciated it so much that I am now buying it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This film is a series of people's personal accounts of their real life experiences, not a presentation of a single philosophy or point of view. Each person is telling a story of an experience they've had where they have felt closer to something or someone that could be called the soul or spirit, the divine, God, Jesus, a higher power, a different dimension, clear light, or however each person chose to express themselves. I found the film to have no particular prejudice or religious leanings, as we hear from Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, atheists, a very broad spectrum of religious or spiritual beliefs. In fact, one of my favorite aspects of the film is that it provides such a diverse range of perspectives rather than trying to steer us towards some particular belief system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I couldn't even say that it espouses a firm belief in reincarnation. Some of the stories implied this belief, but not all, again representing a cross section of beliefs. For example, the primary storytellers about Pre-Birth experiences of the soul were a couple who were so devoutly Christian that the mother describes how she is visited by Jesus who answers her prayers by stopping a miscarriage and escorting her unborn child, who has been reluctant to come onto this earth and be born.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What particularly attracted me to the film is that it looked at the entire cycle of life and how individuals have experienced this at each stage: before birth, during their lives, at death, and after death. I have seen and enjoyed several films about Near Death experiences, particularly those by Dr. Raymond Moody, one of the leading researchers in Near Death experiences. But this is the first film I have encountered that looks at the whole cycle of life and death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
2. I am an avid film buff, viewing 5-7 films a week. Most of them are spiritually oriented, or at least inspirational or educational enough that I feel enriched after watching them, rather than simply entertained (although it's great if I am also entertained in the process of being inspired or educated). So I am quite discriminating about what I consider to be a good film, especially one good enough to buy rather than just rent. And I found this filmmaking to be very well done, with a well-edited blend of these individuals or couples telling their stories, beautiful artwork, an excellent soundtrack, and even some very funny moments. Jean Houston is so funny in telling her stories she could be a stand-up comedian, which is what her father wanted her to be anyway (it's part of her hilarious stories). The music was so good, that I'm also hunting for music by the two soundtrack musicians. There are some well known people telling their stories (Jean Houston, Joan Borysenko, Ram Das, H.H. The Dalai Lama, etc.) as well as many of us more "common folk."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So I highly recommend this film to people who really want to explore the possibility of experiencing the soul. But I do think it wise to rent any film first, including this one, to see if you like it enough to buy it. If you can't find it at your video store, Netflix has it. If you're not a Netflix member, you can get a free trial for a couple of weeks and make this one of your selections. Then if you do like it, I think it would be worthy addition to your spiritual film libray.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
3. I was like the previous reviewer. I had rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental! I loved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience. How lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine, waiting to be returned to. And I didn't learn this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This video illustrates it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that wonderful place that is our true Home. People who are dying yet unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come. My own Mother saw her Mother as she died. She came to take her Home. There is no specific religion addressed here, only the fact that there is more to life than living and dying. And that it is something to be totally unafraid of. In fact physical death is only the beginning of something great; it is a step in the evolution of our souls.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Jane Katra</title>
    <date>2011-11-12</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr; Author, Natural Spiritual Healer</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Jane Katra holds a Ph.D. in Public Health from the University of Oregon, where she taught mind-body health classes in the 1980&amp;#8217;s. Dr. Katra has also practiced as a natural spiritual healer for thirty-four years. Katra is the coauthor with physicist Russell Targ of the books &lt;i&gt;Miracles of Mind: Exploring Nonlocal Consciousness&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spiritual Healing(1998),&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Heart of the Mind (1999)&lt;/i&gt;. Her work has been featured in the book &lt;i&gt;Reinventing Medicine&lt;/i&gt; by Larry Dossey, and in Science of Mind, Natural Health, Alternative Therapies, New Dimensions, Spirituality and Health, and Noetic Sciences Review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thirty years ago, Dr. Jane Katra received instructions about being a spiritual healer during a near-death experience, and in 2003 she began receiving communications from her recently deceased step-daughter. These experiences have launched her on a quest to understand mind-to-mind communications, which involve not only knowing who has telephoned you, but also the possibility of being attuned to and transformed by a greater transpersonal field of Infinite Mind.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:   Joe Wolfe</title>
    <date>2011-12-10</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, 10 years in prison, author, acclaimed ACIM teacher</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from Joe Wolfe:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
    It was 1974 and I was twenty-four years of age at the time. My own history up to that point was one like so many stories of a young street thug, growing up in a working class Chicago neighborhood, discouraged and disillusioned by the mediocrity and grind of what life had to offer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    That there had to be something better was always a predominating thought. So 'better' for me, was the excitement and the radical comradity of our little clique of thugs, always plotting, always stealing, always looking for that thrill. So when those activities resulted in my first arrests, confinement in juvenile punishment facilities and finally in a ten year prison sentence,( the big time), I was brought to a juncture. I would crash and burn. Previously embraced justifications for my anti-social behavior would soon be shattered and all of the glamour of the life of a criminal would cease to contain even a trace of validity. The underlying conviction that there had to be something better still remained but now (after the experience I'll describe below) that something would take on an entirely new and remarkable definition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    So at twenty-four and while wallowing in the misery of prison life this is what occurred that would lead to forever changing the way I would perceive the world:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The real Me...The I...The Essence of Who and Where I AM emerged for just a few short minutes one summer afternoon after an entire sleepless night of worry and immense fear over the possibility that I might be killed the following day.  For the first time in many years I turned to the God I perceived and I prayed for deliverance. I begged and prayed for many hours with fever and intensity never before offered. 'He' answered...'He' delivered me. And for a few brief moments 'He' lifted Me from the body and embraced Me as a loving Father does His Son and assured Me once again, that I would be alright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    While the body lay on the prison cell cot below, the awareness of "I" expanded to include every molecule of air around Me... every feature, the sunlight that streamed through the barred window, the trees and grass outside, the room itself...everything was Me. A crescendo of 'sound' accompanied the experience that completely absorbed all sound on earth and played as every instrument in every orchestra all over the world, in perfect harmony. This experience launched my search for the miraculous.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Now, many years later, and after much search, many books, and after the message of Forgiveness as gently prescribed in A Course in Miracles, I came to realize that the 'person' who searched would never find the answers. That person, a product of the same thought system that created him, would seek and never find because he was simply in the way. His beliefs, his concepts and ascribed personage blocked the very awareness of that which he sought. He had to get out of his own way first. He had to surrender his own image of who he thought he was before any Real knowledge could enter. The little self had to be first seen for what it really was, then sacrificed (for lack of a better word) to make room for something much bigger.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The Law of Forgiveness would lend him the means to do just that. In Forgiveness, the little self would fade into the oblivion from which it came and what would emerge is what was there all along. That Essence of the Real Self, that "I" and that assurance that everything would be alright. And from that Essence a Power uncommon in this perceived world would accompany it and everything would change for the better, forever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Today, almost every day this writer visits the local post office to deliver copies of the original edition of A Course in Miracles [donated by Course in Miracles Society] along with an easy to comprehend introduction to The Course as made available through the text version of Gary R. Renard&amp;#8217;s The End of Reincarnation to lists of prisoners who have expressed the desire to learn more about the Course. With the text version is a brief essay describing what is referred to as The Five Signs, five mystical experiences during this life which began at the age of three and culminated with the experience described above. This experience led to adopting a practical application of the spiritual discipline taught in A Course in Miracles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    With the help of people like Jon Mundy and his Miracles Magazine, Regina Dawn Akers and her The Holy Spirit&amp;#8217;s Interpretation of the New Testament, Gary R. Renard and Tami Simon, (The End of Reincarnation) and Dov Fishman of The One Mind Foundation and Acim Gather, as well as Beverly Hutchenson, Marrianne Williamson, Robert Perry, and those friends who assist with postage donations, and especially Course In Miracles Society, a new wave of compassion is spreading throughout the populations of prisons all over the country.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    For many of these prisoners, long forgotten by family or friends, this new avenue of communication brings welcome relief and a gentle, warm and loving response to their cry for help. It brings Hope where apathy, despair and grief make their home. It delivers Love where blame, guilt and punishment saturate the atmosphere. It brings the possibility of the Peace of God to a &amp;#8216;place&amp;#8217; where the egos appetite for misery, pain and hopelessness can now move aside to welcome a glimmer of Light.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    May the Love, Light and Peace of God be experienced by them, and with every second feel another moment spent in His Endless Embrace.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Guest Speaker:  Paul Perry</title>
    <date>2012-01-14</date>
    <subtitle>NDEr, noted author, filmmaker...</subtitle>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Paul Perry is the co-author of four New York Times bestsellers, including Saved by the Light (which was made into a popular movie) and Evidence of the Afterlife. He has co-authored five books with Dr. Raymond Moody, including a memoir Paranormal, due to be published in 2012. His books have been published in more than 30 languages around the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Paul is also a documentary filmmaker whose work has appeared on worldwide television. His best known film, Jesus, the Lost Years was first the subject of a book he wrote for Random House, which follows the trail believed to be used by the Holy Family as they fled into Egypt to escape the murderous soldiers of King Herod.  He has produced and directed several other films, including one on 18th Century piracy in Madagascar that aired on History Channel in 2011.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
His most recent work,&lt;i&gt; Afterlife,&lt;/i&gt; explores mankind&amp;#8217;s most nagging question, What happens when we die? This and other questions about the Afterlife are scientifically explored through modern research into near-death experiences. Through interviews with noted researchers Raymond Moody, MD, PhD, and Jeffrey Long, MD, this documentary explores the evidence of the afterlife using insightful interviews with researchers, emotional case studies, and crisply done re-creations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#8220;NDEs are spiritual events of staggering magnitude and complexity that have the power to change our attitudes toward death and life&amp;#8221; says director Paul Perry. &amp;#8220;There are reasons people are transformed when they return from a brush with death, one of which is the confidence they gain in knowing that a fresh new world awaits our last heartbeat. Another, especially for the physically ill, is the discovery that we leave our body behind and continue on as spirits free of earthy pain.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Paul is a graduate of Arizona State University, Antioch University in Los Angeles, and a former fellow at the prestigious Gannett Center for Media Studies at Columbia University in New York City. He taught magazine writing at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, and was Executive Editor at American Health magazine, a winner of the National Magazine Awards for General Excellence. Since becoming a full-time writer, Paul has written or co-written more than 20 books on a variety of topics, including biography, health, medical science, and history.

    <title>Dr. Eben Alexander  III, MD</title>
    <date>2012-03-10</date>
    <subtitle>Neurosurgeon, Author, has an amazing Near-Death Experience</subtitle>
    <body> &lt;p&gt;     Eben Alexander III MD has been an academic neurosurgeon for the last 25 years, including 15 years at Harvard Medical School. He dealt with hundreds of patients suffering from alterations in their level of consciousness, none of whom was able to provide much insight concerning their experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
            In the predawn hours of Nov. 10, 2008, he became a comatose patient. For reasons still obscure, he was overcome by bacterial meningitis, rendered comatose on a ventilator in the ICU within hours. His physicians were stunned to find that the culprit was E. coli, which never causes meningitis in patients over 3 months of age unless they were infected in a neurosurgical procedure (which he had not been). After 6 days on triple antibiotics, showing no response, with little neurological function remaining, his physicians had few words of encouragement for his family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
            On day seven, he opened his eyes, to the surprise of all! However, his earliest recollections were strange and involved no recall of his life before coma. Like a newborn, he had no functioning language, nor knowledge of this world, our culture, or loved ones surrounding him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
            Memories from the time in coma were inexplicable. The purest and most extraordinary part of his journey happened deep in coma. His entire neocortex, that outer surface of the brain that makes us human, was totally disengaged by the meningitis. How was it possible for that rich experience to originate in his brain?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
            His story offers a critical key to the understanding of consciousness, spirituality and human existence. The human part of his brain, the neocortex, died for a week. In the midst of that, he had an extraordinary experience that could not have occurred in his brain, given our current understanding of neuroscience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
            The implications are mind-boggling! In analyzing the scientific possibilities and grand implications, he sees a more complete reconciliation of modern science and spirituality as a natural product. He has been blessed with a complete recovery, and is now writing a book about his most powerful, life-changing story.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Mary Neal is a board-certified orthopaedic spine surgeon who drowned while kayaking on a South American river. She experienced life after death. She went to heaven and back, conversed with with angels and experienced God's encompassing love. She was returned to Earth with some specific instructions for work she still needed to do. Her life has been one filled with the miracles and intervention of God. Her story gives reason to live by faith and is a story of hope.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dr. Neal was born and raised in Michigan and graduated from the University of Kentucky before attending the UCLA medical school. She completed her orthopaedic surgery training at the University of Southern California after which she lived in Sweden, Switzerland, and Los Angeles while undergoing 1 1/2 years of specialty training in spinal surgery before becoming the director of spine surgery at USC. Five year later, she left the University for private practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She currently lives and works in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where she and her family enjoy everything the outdoors offers, especially all forms of skiing, bicycling, boating, and hiking.
